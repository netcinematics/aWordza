I've never studied the origins of language, but I was listening to a bird sing outside my window and as I was singing back, caused the bird to become even more comfortable and sing much more elaborate sounds, apart from the normal chirp chirp

Everything was fine, until I could hear the call of a more aggressive bird spieces enter the yard, and then the songbird song stopped abruptly. This made me think of this as an analog to human communications. We need to feel safe, then try out a simple song, if we receive feedback that it is safe to sing, and that the singing is appreciated, we become encouraged to sing more advanced note, a bit louder. But if discouraging sounds return from our song - we are frightened enough to stop singing all together. Including sometimes we wish someone else would stop singing. And who is to say the 'caw' of a crow, is less of a song, than the 'chirp' 'chirp' of a finch?

Also over time, this seems to have profound affect/effect, in that the songs of birds safe over decades, may continuously advance in tenor, while the birds under continuous aggression... would perhaps change to never sing at all?

I wonder if that is the same for the human mind? In safe places we tend to think and speak more? IN unsafe places, we tend to think and speak honestly less? In an encouraging society, safety nets and support systms are in place for more people to be actually innovative, while aggressive and competitive societies may discourage minds from questioning anything at all?
