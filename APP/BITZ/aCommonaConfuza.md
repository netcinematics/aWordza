Taxonomy or Ontology.


> All_Human_Mind exists within a_Common_Confuzion at birth, and again at death.

By articulating common confuzions, Actual_Reality can_be_known.

### Articles_of_Current_Confuzion

#### aTaboo_of_Confuzion

The first way that we are confuzed, is when society forces minds to refuze to admit - when confuzed.

#### aParrotaMentoa or aRobotaMinda

The second was we are confuzed, is when a mind is taught an answer, and simply repeats it.
Without ever actually evaluating the concept_under_words. Where the concept part_wrong we are confuzed.

#### aPretendaKnowa

When we forget that we were repeating the answer, and overlook that we never actually evaluate the concept, then we begin to pretend to know a depth of knowledge, that is never actually there.


#### aBroadaBrusha or aBineality.

When we say social~phrases like,  "I agree 100%" or "absolutely", this is often part_flawed. In these ACTZ we paint the concepts with a broad brush, covering cracks in logic - that reveal themselves again over time. Similarly, the viewz of all-right and all-wrong are often partly_flawed. To look at the world with such VIEWZ, is called a_BINARY_REALITY.

#### DEPTH_of_LOGIC and aLimitaMinda

When the brain cannot hold focus on too many data points, we tend to blank out - and lose focus of everything. That is called overwhelm. And certain DEPTH_of_LOGIC can perplex many minds, creating a barrier of those concepts to be blocked from review by a significant portion of society. aLIMITaMINDa is similar in that there is an actual_limit_of_mind. Sometimes this can be on available information, or exculpatory evidence. But since we can experience overwhelm and blank_out - it is quite possible to humans to arrive at wrong_conclusions simply because they do not have TIME or FOCUS to sort through all the facts and hold all the concepts in the minds eye.

#### Mistake of POSITIVITY and NEGATIVITY

Often we can hear thought leaders in society saying phrases like, "i dont want to be negative", or "look on the bright side". The problem with these statements, while seeking to act wizely by repeating old social norms, are actually deep into folly because a fairly easy to see flaw. Easily forgivable because, it seems to never have been described before.

# THE_MATRIX_of_EN_an_DIS or THE_MATRIX_of_aSparka_and_aDarka.

Instead of putting the emphasis on "positivity and negativity" society would be much more correct to emphasize "encouragement" "discouragement" for the following overlooked ACTZ. 

Sometimes we actually discourage good.
Sometimes we actually encourage bad.

These ACTZ (when they actually occur) are called aINVERZIONZ.

And they appear to cauze all_human_mind all sorts of enigma, social_dillema, and affect/effect tragedy.

The ACTZ we so commonly reference in partial_wizdom of "positivity", "negativity" trope is:

Sometimes we actually encourage good.
Sometimes we actually discourage bad.

NOTE: we are NOT trying to measure good or bad <yet> just defining it where it actually occures in reality (whether we know it or not). Measurement of actual_good and actual_bad occurs later, in advanced topics, but we do not use the words good and bad, because they are too diluted.


# WE_are_actually_MISSING_WORDS

Where we actually lack WORDS, we also lack ability to reference the CONCEPTS.
So LACK_of_WORDS, largely equates to LIMITED_CONCEPTZ
Societies that have LACK_of_WORDS and LIMITED_CONCEPTZ, would be reasonably confuzed, exactly where the void of words exist.

NOTE: as usual, the exact_opposite_concept also appears true - that EXTRA_WORDZ appears to largely generate EXTRA_CONCEPTZ, but that is also an advanced topic for another section.

# LACK_of_WORDS around aSocioaTaboo

One of the many interesting aspects of SOCIAL~PHRASES is that they tend to map the LIMIT_of_MIND. Here is why. Social_Phrases are often observably silly or fuzzy nature. This appears to be from the lack of evaluation of what we are actually saying. When we gloss_over_details of phrases, we also gloss_over_details of the CONCEPT_beneath_WORDS.

So when society enacts aTaboo on seamonsters... there is a delay set upon the study and better naming of the concepts.
And society can be expected to be confused on those topics until the aTaboo is lifted.

#### LACK_of_WORDZ around CONCEPTS_a_BEYOND_US

Similarly, to confuzion existing around topics we chooze to avoid, there is also confuzion around topics that we have not yet deciphered a reflection to actureality. A stunning example of this, can be observed in a word count of the "positive" and "negative" words, but not in a binary sense. Count all the words that reference ENCOURAGEMENT and all the words that reference DISCOURAGEMENT and you may see a stark epiphany of what a young species all_human_mind truly is.


NOTE: this is an advanced topic for later chapters, but worth a brief description here, to describe confuzion.
The hypothesis goes, that there is a vast majority of aDissa words, but also it appears that there is nearly enemic or mal-nourished number of words for ENCOURAGEMENT and aEna. A massive imbalance appears to exist with an enourmous number of aDissa words compared to aEna words. In addition, a good number of the aEna words that exist appear to have been distorted, or INVERTED (from the confuzion described above). So it appears, there is actual missing words for encouragement, while we exist within an overwhelm of concepts of aDissa. What could account for this? Maybe it is that we arose from a brutal species? And are still young in our awareness? Is this what the minds of 1000yrz from now will see?
That the young human species was tilted linguistically toward distructive actz, rather than enstructive actz? By nature of our coming into education and intelligence gradually and irregularly? This is discussed at length later.

Maybe they will know that with a lack of words, is a lack of concepts, and with a lack of concepts - society would be excepted to be confuzed.

#### aWrongaBossa

Authority does not do anyone a favor by twisting reality to meet personal needs. 

It only seeds conflict for the future, where projected_reality can never reflect actual_reality.

#### aWronga 

Actually_really_wrong. Not just wrong, but offensively wrong. Discouraging concept.

#### Flaw of HERO_VILLIAN, ANGEL_DEMON

The fairly obvious flaw is that it projects a static state onto a dynamic being.

Not accounting for innerstate, or exculpatory facts, but glosses over details in broad_brush binary_reality.

Labeling a person... evil... may never be totally fair. For the following reasons.

1) The person labeling "evil" wrongly, may be more "evil" than the person labeled "evil"

2) The villian is totally bad, but what if they do it so that they can go home - and be a great dad?

Are they really evil? Is the person labeling them the villian the true villian?

3) The hero is seen as totally good, until they go home in their super ego - and are a totally negligent father.

Are they really a hero to the children they ignore?

If we gloss over such viewz, we are making these common confuzionz, as a BINARY_REALITY.

But if we capture these viewz, when they reflect actual_reality, then we_can_see with more clarity.

`~aDoublaConfuza~`

Society is like a soup_of_confuzion. There are so many layers of different viewz. We experience overwhelm before we can account for them all. And so default to choozing the one repeated most by our society.


If there are more than one confuzionz at any one time we can experience actual_double_confuzion. And can expect many minds to be perplexed. It is not often that a mind has enough clarity to see through two puzzles to a solution.


`~aSocioaConfuza~`

It is not uncommon for entire groups of people to be aWronga about something. The biggest problem about this, is when authority insists that they are not wrong, pretending to know, and setting up those who possess actual clarity of mind - ineveitable conflict over articulations of actual_reality. We need better systems for admitting actual wrongness, without punishment or demotion or shame or bullying, so we can all convert more rapidly to reflect actual_reality. That concept is advanced, but is called `~aDebtaValidita~` actual_debt_validated.


`~aForceaConfuza~`

Sometimes confuzion is natural, like at birth. But other times society can force us  into confuzion by insisting that we memorize and repeat things that are not actual - and then threaten taboo, shaming, or silence as retaliation if we do not repeat the social_phrases as scripted. This parrot and robot behavior makes it easy to determine affiliation to the group, and outcasts for minor offenses against the will of the authority. Is it ok for humans to force others to be confuzed against their will? Where does this happen? How? And what is the Affect/Effect?


`~AntidotaConfuza~`

Ironically, the antidote to all confuzion is WORDZ. And for the most part it is always WORDS. Additional mechanisms are SYMBOLS and SONG_Lyrics and ART. But in all cases, we really cannot alleviate the fog of confuzion until we can put it into words that reflect actual_reality.

> WORDZ are the antidote_of_confuzion
