## TheHumanEnigma

There exists an actual edge of human cognition. Where exactly, we cannot know, exactly because it is incomprehensible to know what is not comprehensible. Exactly because the moment we become aware of something, we cannot be simultaneously unaware of it too.

Comprehending existence in real time actueality - a blizzard of insigts arise spontaneously in mind. Then, is the hard work of EVALUATING, before NAMING, and ARTICULATING
what is ACTUAL REALITY. That is the PROCESS. No one owns ACTUAL REALITY. No one owns the ability or make sense of ACTUAL REALITY. No one owns the inability to see actual reality. How many people own the abilty to block your awareness of actual reality? Look at that.

There we have the EDGE. A highly elusive concept to render to mind - the edge of human comprehension. But with careful naming... allHumanMinds are given the ability to immediately access the three (distinct) variations of the concept: Original or Twisted, or Void.

A. The concept (physically) in mind by way of electrons (aZepto). 

THE HUMAN ENIGMA is the NON-VISIBLE barrier between what we think is correct, and what is actual reality. All sorts of strange behaviors (ACTZ) result from a mind pretending to know the actual, but is actually not reflective of what is actually real (actueality). The mind~state, of thinking it aDissactueality. Thinking of this space as being a physical space, helps to visualize it. For example: all of the concepts ever thought are hovering in space, and we are either connected by a string of bubbles to that concept or not. Importantly, we think we have thought all of the thoughts there is to think, but that is waaay off. There are a near infinity of thoughts possible to think, and the thoughts that cross our minds in a lifetime is scant few. So why do we pretend to know everything? Does this society reward us for pretending to know? Are we rewarded when we guess correct - even though we have no concept for why it is a correct answer?

## TheConceptualPretzel!

Existing among every human mind, is a limitation of awareness (aEdgeovAWA). That aEdgeovAWA is always non-visible, and can never be fully quantified. Small parts of the aEdgeovAWA can be viewed, but very imprecisely, because even upon proving a missing concept, or flawed, twizted, or flight-of-fantasy CONCEPT - the actual concept in mind can change. So viewing aEdgeovAWA, is at maximum - a singular and imprecise snapshot of a mental view - in time. And even as soon as it is known, it can instantly change. The aEdgeovAWA is composed of a myriad of aZeptos. Actual remarkable concepts, always: either reflecting actueality, not reflecting actueality, or wholly void.

TheConceptualPretzel can be mapped! Not in real-time, but in passed time. Historically, AnyoneCanSee how our anscestors were blatantely wrong. Although, we often experience the aCommonFlaw of "respecting elders" so much that we "accept actual foolishness". Or in aBetterWordz, historically we tend to repeat and mimic past best-practices - when we don't actually re-evaluate their actueality apart from adissactueality.
