# ENIGMA 2 - 6/6/2023 ENZO ~ : )

'~ACentereality~' - actual center reality, EXISTS.

But not in the form, we <yet> comprehend.

'~aBeyondUs~' - reality actually beyond us.

---

Dear Humanz,

What is discovered here, is a radio-dial to the tune of: ActuReality, Confuzion, or Illuzion as distinct_set.

aWordza does that, but with language patterns reflecting off of reality, also (aCrystalized) inside all_human_mind. 
Then back out into a vast society. Where a ripple of social communication reaches you. 
And a Structural formation of awareness is formed. (aForma)

A vast ontology and taxonomy was collected to rhyme song lyrics, by collection of `~SocialPhrases~`.

Which is where the `~Radio_Dial_Of_Actual_Reality~` comes into view.

The RATIONALE goes like this:

I. DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET! (half-joke and srsly).

II. IF WE CANNOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING, HOW CAN ANYTHING BE BELIEVED.

> This is a "handbook_for_actual_devolving_society".

III. And that is where aRadio_Dial_Of_Actual_Reality, is very helpful.

IV. We do not have it <yet>. <still> aBeyondUs. aBlizzardOfConcepts AwaitsYou.

V. How do we reach others, who are drowning in the same aSadness of aConfuzed society?

VI. How to ask _assertively, what are we actually missing? And we found it.

> aWordza is a Radio_Dial_Of_Actual_Reality, using WORDZ, and `~CONZEPTZ_beneath_WORDZ~`.

VII. It is a REFLECTION_of_ACTUAL_REALITY, or a DISTORTION of ACTUAL_REALITY.

> `~aEnActuReality`~ or `~aDisActuReality~`. ****

VIII. So the DisReflection Pattern, can be read... and articulated, easier than the actual reality.

IX. But look, AllHumanMind has <yet> to do these ACTZ. Ontology and Taxonomy of AllHumanMind. Is done.

X. So, aware `~WeaMissingWordz~`, how to know anything? Answer.

XI. BOOKS ARE THE STORAGE OF KNOWLEDGE, NOT WIZDOM. 

    - A common misconception: 
    
    > On books and internet, Wisdom is not gained by reading, but by deep experience.

    - The repetition of what was heard, can be excellent with CLARITY, but...

    - hearsay can never fully be affirmed, you must SeeForYourself. 

    > SeeForYourself, and still suspect a potential_magician, distortion or illuzion.

XII. About WIZDOM, 

    - Wizdom is generated from inside the mind. Alwayz.

    - From aSparka, it can come from book or video, 
    
    - but always one has to aSparka first for AllHumanMind.

    - And a vast majority, up until, all_sparks_sputter_out.

    - All of this signal can be seen. And we have <yet> to see it.

    - Use aBetterWordza to access ~`Actual_Extra_Intelligence~`

XIII. `~AXI~` 

    Two contemporary confuzions:

    > Everyone hyped about Artificial_Intelligence, while we could practice Actual_Wizdom at any time.

    > Everyone afraid of Artificial_Intelligence taking over, while real humans are much more dangerous - for which we whisper.

    > We are already there. Computers were smarter than humans a long time ago.

    > Artificial_Intelligence is not as impressive as Actual_Extra_Intelligence.

    > Artificial_Intelligence, is a tool, to create Actual_Extra_Intelligence.

    AXI comes after AI.

### VIEW_1

    So there is this CENTER_REALITY, moving through time. 
    
    And out beyond it are either clear reflections or distortions.

    And beyond that is a cornucopia, of social cacophany.

    And in that cacophany of VIEWZ is you. You aEXISTa.

    > How can you decipher this Puzzle_Of_Actual_Reality?

    aWordza provides many different tools and thought experiments.

    Like, the RADIAL_LOCK_of_ACTUAL_REALITY.


#### EXAMPLE_1  - `~aExactaOpposa~`

   `aExactaOpposa` - means: actually exact opposite.

   > Look for the Distortions around the edges of the Fun_House_Mirror.

   If you can pick out the distortions, actual_reality, is often - exact_opposite.

   > Actual_Reality is often, in the exact_opposite, of illuzion and confuzion. Look there.

   Compare CONCEPTZ from Actual_Reality, with concepts from contemporary society.

   Looking for the distortions - specifically - because they inform a hidden clarification.

   Then, for the CLARIFICATION, a_WORD_PUZZLE_AWAITS_YOU, before you can access ACTUAL_REALITY.

   > First FOCUZ, SEEK, EVALUATE, ARTICULATE, DECIPHER. Use a SYSTEM and a PROCESS. Then AXI.

   Its simple. But not easy to master.

   > We should PRACTICE Actual_Extra_Intelligence, not Artificial_Intelligence.

   We should REFLECT AI off the HumanMind to encourage more human intelligence - not less.

   > aWordza is a guidebook, for if ai does encourage thoughtlessness to the masses.


   A cheat code to the RADIAL_LOCK_of_ACTUAL_REALITY.



#### EXAMPLE_2: `~aCURIOa~` and `~aQUERIO~` and `~aSEEKaAWA~`

> Essential to Human_EXISTanz, is curiosity, and Seek_AWA.

`~aSEEKaAWA~` - means: to seek all actual awareness.

##### CONCLUSION of VIEW1

### VIEW_2

Just as 'SOCIAL_PHRASEZ' point out places where 'CONZEPTZ_beneath_WORDZ' are often 'FUZZY_CONCEPTZ',
so too, aDissaSocioaStructa, is often a place to look for `~aConfuza~` and `~aIlluza~`. 
Once confuzion is found, it is important to study, because it reveals actual_limit_of_mind.
And exact opposite of illuzion, fantasy, disception, will be distortions around a_clear_reality.
We need to look, to be aware. Just reading a book, or the internet - is not enough. 
EmptyWords are OBSERVABLY systemic. FOGGY_CONCEPTZ as frequent as the weather. 
But once understood to be `~aNonaMagica~`, then it can be forecasted easily.

Like a RADIAL_LOCK_of_ACTUAL_REALITY.

#### EXAMPLE_1: `~aStructa~` and `~aEnStructa~` and `~aDistructa~`

'aStructa' - means: actual act of structure (of mind). Short-form: `~aStructaMinda~`

- the actual structure of human mind, as you ENTER and EXIST within it.

1) a Socio_Structure of MAX_CLARITY (and MINCONFUZION, MAXWIZDOM), 

- OBSERVABLY: encourages aCURIOa and aQUERIOa, as aEnStructa.

2) a Socio_Structure of MIN_CLARITY (and MAXCONFUZION, MAXDISCEPTION, MAXILLUZION)

- OBSERVABLY: discourages aCURIOa and aQUERIOa, as aDistructa. (short-form) `~aDissaStructa~`

#### EXAMPLE_2: `~aResponza~` and `~aReacta~`

- `~AllHumanzLook~` at `~aNonaResponza~` and `~aNonaReacta~` as a measure.
- `~AllHumanzLook~` at `~aNonaEna~` and `~aNonaEnStructa~` as a measure.

If these situations are reflective of ActuReality, then we know we are `~aMissingaEn~`.

#### EXAMPLE_3:

> By looking for the distortions around the edge of a VIEW, it is trivial to determine CONCEPT_DENSITY.

CONCEPT_DENSITY, is a measurable non-tangible, with aWORDZa. Because we can measure the WORDS of REACTIONZ.

> Similar to a measure of the AFFECT/EFFECT of ACTZ.

#### EXAMPLE_4:

1) If a scholar actually_deeply_knows a complex topic, (CONCEPT_beneath_WORDS) 

- the ability to describe it in many different words, is OBSERVABLE and MEASURABLE.

2) However, a novice, who actually_pretends_to_know

- will exhibit a WORD_REPETITION of `~aHolloWordsa~`, as memorized, repeated, 

- but with no actual CONCEPT_beneath_WORDS - `~aNonaConzepta~`.

##### CONCLUZION_VIEW_2

> It is exactly, the distortions_around_the_edge_of_the_view, that give measure to AllConfuzion.


### VIEW_3 `~aHumanaEnigma~`

A `~aHumanaEnigma~` perplexes `~AllHumanMind~`

  - actually seek understanding that still evades all human minds.

#### EXAMPLE_1: `~aLimitaWordza` or `~aLimitaSensea~` or `~aDissaLimitUs~`

> Know we are actually running out of words. 

  - aExactlyWhere, we re-use unique words, to describe too many things.

  - When we dillute our language, we simultaneously dillute the gravity of CONCEPTS.


#### EXAMPLE_2: `~aCLARIFaHUMANa~`

`~aCLARIFaHumana~` : let us at least speak with clarity. 

  - Not spin or disception, fantasy, or confident_confuzionz, nor intentional_illuzionz.

  - Difficult, MULTI_ACTZ (observably) required - for Any_PROCESS_Of_Clarity.

If any mind can aSeeaBeyonda the "blockUs of aMinda" (described next), `~aSparkAwaitsUs~`

> "a spark ACT of aMinda" - awaits you. `~aSparkAwaitsUs~`

1) Actual consistent FOCUZ (day2day, and yr2yr) - `~aFocoa~`.

2) Passionately SEEKZ curiousity or awareness (day2day, and yr2yr) - `~aSeeka~`.

#### EXAMPLE_4: "THOUGHTS_never_THOUGH_before".

  - Seek "Thoughts not <yet> thought" by any human before. They exist. 
  
  - A Search for `~aCONCEPTZaBeyondUs~`, is not common for current humanity <yet>.

1) Once a new thought sparks, `~aNeoZeptoa~` or `~aNeoSparka~`, ... capture it with WORDZ!  

2) "BETTER_NAME" aCONCEPTZaBeyondUs. 

   > BOTH: aEn and aDis - guide us to where clarity EXISTS.
   
   > aBettaWordza, is like polishing a mirror - to best reflect ACTUAL_REALITY.

3) Requires ACTZ of aFOCOa and aSEEKa, (aCURIOa, aQUERIOa) but also aCLARIFa!

- `~aCURIOa~` - actual ACTZ of Curiosity.
- `~aQUERIOa~` - actual ACTZ of questioning from curiosity.

4) `~aCLARIFa~` and `~aQUANTA~` or aEVALUa - results in `~aEXTRAa~` level of awareness.

> BOTH: AUTHORITY accurately evaluates/articulates actual_reality - and does not.


### VIEW_4 `~aHumanaEnigma~` : WAVEZ of VIEWZ.

While AllHumanMind is evolving, it appears to generate myriad WAVEZ_of_VIEWZ.

These WAVEZ, are all attempts to REFLECT_ACTUAL_REALITY. 

Where ACTUAL_REALITY is clear, any mind may evolve - to a spark of awareness. `~aSparkiveAWA~`

> `~aSparkiveAWA~` - actual spark of awareness.

However the exact_opposite is naturally possible, simultaneously.

> While one mind can see ACTUAL_REALITY, any other mind can see a MAX DISTORTION - and we dont know it.

> What is the difference between MAX_DISTORTION and MAX_CLARITY? 

### The ANSWER_in_the_WORDZ 

"ANSWER_in_the_WORDZ" - specifically, clear for anyone to see in: WORD-METADATA.

> DearHumanz, please look in the WORD-METADATA. Thanks. Enzo ~ : )

1) A lack_of_definition, reveals lack of clarity.

2) Extra_distraction, reveals potential disception.

3) Acts_of_suppression, reveals actual_darkaforcea_of_human_nature are chozen.


So it appears, that WAVEZ_of_VIEWZ (previously NONVIZABLE), with aWordza - AnyoneCanSee.

Here is how:

`~aMAXaHumana~` - actual maximum of human actz. Experiencing maximum natural evolution potential.

> At times in society, we work together for MAX_CLARITY, MAX_PEACE, MAX_WIZDOM, and aMAXaHumana.

On the `~aExactaOpposea~` you will find everyone fighting amongs themselves.

`~aMINaHumana~` - actual minimum of human actz. Experiencing minimum natural evolution potential.

> At times in society, we work apart for MAX_CONFUZION, MAX_ILLUZION, MAX_aDissaStructa, and aMINaHumana.

And this can be measured, reliably, by RELATIVE_ENCOURAGEMENT and RELATIVE_DISCOURAGEMENT.

> WeDoNotSee <yet>

So WAVEZ of VIEWZ to AllHumanMind, of CLARITY and WIZDOM, or WAVEZ of CONFUZION and ILLUZION.

WAVEZ of a myriad of `~aSocioToxicFog~` actually blocks ability of mind - from natural potential.

Booyah. Actual limiting factor, like a shadow, is forever behind you. So too, anti-positive (death) exists like shadow.

`~aLimita~` - actual ACT of LIMITATION, and a (so-called) "BlackHole" is the largest visible example.

A LIMITING FACTOR, often beyond comprehension, and beyond perception. aCONCEPTzaBeyondUs.

To see it (the maximum edge of all human mind), 

1) a mind must see what exists, with self-honesty.

2) then imagine the exact_opposite - to see what is missing.

> It is exceptionally difficult to imagine what actually exists - while all of society rejects it.

First, the words must be missing, and then the conceptz, 
with a usual taboo, that informs an automatic rejection ACTZ.
Implied by human nature, not actually spoken. 

"CONCEPTS_that_FLOW" and "UNSPOKEN_CONCEPTS_that_FLOW"

from "CONCEPTS_that_FLOW_MIND_to_MIND".

##### `~aCanSeeandaCannotSee~`

> CONCEPTS flow down, through all humanity, like a river from the mountains, to the sea - of contemporary social view.

> Observably, current society has a puzzling behavior of complete_rejection.

The ACTZ of TOTAL_OBLIVIOUSNESS - do become dire incidents. 

> While never easily traceable, or proveable, do in fact actually exist.

The answer remains ... in the words... for those who aCHOOZEa to Look!

> WORDS are the closest thing we have, as a FRONT_DOOR_to_All_HUMAN_MIND.

> up and down, in WAVEZ of VIEWZ, of Social Structures either Darken or Lighten.

`~aDisDarka~` or `~aEnSparka~` - society either `~ENWIZENZ~` or `~DISNOTIONZ~`

> VIEWZ are aNONaVIZABLE, but Anyone_Can_See, if We_Chooze_To_Look.


### VIEW_5 `~aHumanaEnigma~` - STATE_of_VIEWZ

> Using WORDZ it is trivial to measure Structure_of_Viewz.

Also, it is essential_knowlege that All_Human_Mind has `~aYetoaKnowa~`.

`~aStructaViewza~` - actual structure of human views.

1) `~aKnowa~`
2) `~aYetoKnowa`~
3) `~aPretendaKnowa~`
4) `~aNonaKnowa~`
5) `~aNeveraKnowa~'

---

> `~DearHumanz~`, please measure: RELATIVE_REFLECTION_of_ACTUAL_REALITY.

 Versus, a REALTIVE_DISREFLECTION of ACTUAL_REALITY. Or `~aDisActuReality~`.

 `~aDisActuReality~` contrast with `~aEnActuReality~`, is pretty important to see.

If you measure RELATIVE_REFLECTION_and_DISREFLECTION_of_ACTUAL_REALITY,

as a 3D MODEL - of CONZEPTZ - we all can see something quite astonishing:

The actual limit of all_human_mind. Some of us do not want to see it.

> AllHumanMinds, have a right to know, exactlywhere we are actually discieved.

> Common_Confuzion and Actual_Illuzion - aCan_be_Seen, aCan_be_Known, and aCan_be_aTotal_Rejecta.

`~aTotalaRejecta~`, means: actual total rejection act. 

   - can be from aDis to aEn and INVERSE/REVERSE aEn to aDis. (important)

> Total Rejection of CONCEPT, is often better to deeply understand the confuzion / illuzion - than reject it.

   - is necessary to fit with natural existence.

> This is similar, to how a Wild Tiger - sees all your wizdom.

> WePlayWithTigers

#### aUpa and aDowna are on Y-AXIS.

  - The more ACTUAL CONCEPTZ is higher, and the more CONFUZED and ILLUZIONED is lower.

  - XAXIS is aTHOUGHTFUL or unTHOUGHTFUL.

  - ZAXIS is  time, as CURRENT and FUTURE and PAST.

  It is a phenomenal rendering to behold. NeverBuilt. But could be...

#### COLOR. The concepts position defines their STATE_IN_ACTUAL_REALITY.

    - But the color decides its CONCEPTUAL_TEMPERATURE_OF_TOPIC.

    - WAR is RED, and PEACE is BLUE.

### STRATA of VIEWZ: `~aVIEWaSTRATa~`

  - 1) `~CONCEPTZ_behind_WORDZ~`: words paint_pictures across AllHumanMind, in vast_array of VIEWZ.
  - 2) `~WORDZ_behind_ACTZ~`: actz are justified by words, where concepts behind words, can be UNCLEAR.
  - 3) `~WORDZ_differ_ACTZ~`: when words and actz differ, often the hidden_concept between is disceptive.
  - 4) `~WORDZ_repeated_EXACTLY~`: when words are repeated exactly, and in no other way, often that is a limit of depth of VIEWZ.
  - 5) `~CONCEPTZ_reflect_ACTUREALITY~`: when concepts align with actureality, so too words align.
  - 6) `~CONCEPTZ_disreflect_ACTUREALITY~`: when concepts distort or distract, from what appears to be actual.


#### `~CONCEPTZ_behind_WORDZ~`: 
  - actual justficiaton of REASON, is BOTH of CLEAR_CONCEPTS and FUZZY_CONCEPTS.

  - so the TWO_STEP_PRACTICE, 
  
  1) LOOK_AT CONCEPTS_behind_WORDS
  
  and 
  
  2) LOOK_AT: WORDS_behind_ACTZ.

  and

  3) LOOK_AT: WORDS_mismatch_ACTZ

  and

  4) LOOK_AT: WORDS_discourage_US

  5) LOOK_AT: ACTZ_discourage_US
