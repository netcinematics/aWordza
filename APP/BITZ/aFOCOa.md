All_humanz_look, how the ENCOURAGING_SIDE (aEn) words of the ENGLISH LANGUAGE, is (at current) massively underdeveloped compared to the DISCOURAGING_SIDE (aDis) words of the english language. And for GOOD_REASON!

All_humanz_look, what young_human_awareness emerges from! 

> Current_Human_Intelligence, is still recently emergent - from a_hundred_thousand_years_of_chaos.

So we must be realistic in our self-assessment of all_human_mind.

> Basically, all_human_mind_woke_up_yesterday, and we_make_mistakes.

Wizdom, appears to trickle through all_human_mind - randomly.

The horror, shock, and surprise, and rejection of mistakes - is iteself a mistake.

we_are_mistaken_by_default so mistake_shame is a_second_mistake. a_second_confuzion

Why? 

> Becauze, we_can_learn_from_mistakes, or we can reject them, and avoid_seeing_mistakes

Refuse_admit_mistakes, seems like a VICE_GRIP_LOGIC holding SOLO_FOCUS of vast majority of all_human_mind.

`~aMistakea~` is to be expected, but `~aTragicaMistakea~` is aChozen_by_insista_non_a_mistakea,

This actual act makes mistakes tragic, because we can repeat the folly_of_mistaken_confidence, and under_evaluation_of_actual_reality, for many generations.
