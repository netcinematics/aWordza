# `~aCONFUZa~`

Observably, all_human_mind exists in aMassiveConfuzion, being relatively young with awareness.

What will FUTURE_HUMANS know that current society has <yet> to know.

The difference, will be written in wordz.

And POST1000yrz, the difference in actz, will be aHumanza.

> All humanity has a right to be free of confuzion if we chooze it.

But yet,

- some minds discourage thinking

- some minds discourage feeling

- some minds discourage sensing

- some minds discourage heart



- clouds_of_confuzion

- smoke_of_illuzion

- fog_of_folly

All_Human_Mind is born into Clouds_of_Confuzion, and Fog_of_Folly can befall any_mind_at_any_moment, but smoke_of_illuzion is an especially tricky magician.
