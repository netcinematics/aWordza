# `~aCONFUZa~`

Observably, all_human_mind exists in aMassiveConfuzion, being relatively young with awareness.

What will FUTURE_HUMANS know that current society has <yet> to know.

The difference, will be written in wordz.

And POST1000yrz, the difference in actz, will be aHumanza.

> All humanity has a right to be free of confuzion if we chooze it.

But yet,

- some minds discourage thinking

- some minds discourage feeling

- some minds discourage sensing

- some minds discourage heart



- clouds_of_confuzion

- smoke_of_illuzion

- fog_of_folly

All_Human_Mind is born into Clouds_of_Confuzion, and Fog_of_Folly can befall any_mind_at_any_moment, but smoke_of_illuzion is an especially tricky magician.

`~aNaturaConfuza~`

Confuzion is natural by birth and at death. One confuzed topic is a_Shame_of_Confuzion. We should not feel aShameaConfuza, because confuzion is natural, and is everpresent, and inevitable. But yet we often act in total rejection of the reality of being confuzed. Which is a double_confuzion, because not only are we confuzed in the first place, but we also discourage the confuzion, rejecting it, and pretending to know, and sometimes retaliating against the messenger_of_actual_reality - which greatly complicated the social situation. As described in other topics.

`~aDoublaConfuza~`

Society is like a soup_of_confuzion. There are so many layers of different viewz. We experience overwhelm before we can account for them all. And so default to choozing the one repeated most by our society.


If there are more than one confuzionz at any one time we can experience actual_double_confuzion. And can expect many minds to be perplexed. It is not often that a mind has enough clarity to see through two puzzles to a solution.


`~aSocioaConfuza~`

It is not uncommon for entire groups of people to be aWronga about something. The biggest problem about this, is when authority insists that they are not wrong, pretending to know, and setting up those who possess actual clarity of mind - ineveitable conflict over articulations of actual_reality. We need better systems for admitting actual wrongness, without punishment or demotion or shame or bullying, so we can all convert more rapidly to reflect actual_reality. That concept is advanced, but is called `~aDebtaValidita~` actual_debt_validated.


`~aForceaConfuza~`

Sometimes confuzion is natural, like at birth. But other times society can force us  into confuzion by insisting that we memorize and repeat things that are not actual - and then threaten taboo, shaming, or silence as retaliation if we do not repeat the social_phrases as scripted. This parrot and robot behavior makes it easy to determine affiliation to the group, and outcasts for minor offenses against the will of the authority. Is it ok for humans to force others to be confuzed against their will? Where does this happen? How? And what is the Affect/Effect?


`~AntidotaConfuza~`

a_corrective_lens_for_all_social_confuzion

Ironically, the antidote to all confuzion is WORDZ. And for the most part it is always aWORDZa. Additional mechanisms, for expressing CONCEPTS_yet_ARTICULATED: are SYMBOLS and SONG_LYRICS, and POETRY and ART. But in all cases, 

> we really cannot alleviate the fog of confuzion until we craft_words to ever_more_accurately_reflect_actual_reality. 

`~aEverMoreaReflecta~` - aExactaOpposa of `~aNonaCraftaConcepta~`, or `~aPretendaKnowAlla~`, or `~aRobotaMinda`~.

> aPERFECTaWORDZa is the antidote_of_all_confuzion

NOTE: This also includes a more advanced PRACTICE of aSYMBOLza and aEXPREZZa.

> Society is especially confuzed, under experience of actual_forced_social_confuzion.

NOTE: This does not say WHEN actual_social_toxicity begins or ends (here). But an advanced topic, does address exactly how to measure actual_level_of_disception in social_flows. In addition to, how any_mind_can_see, the exact level_of_smoke_in_the_backroom. And then also, the actual_Non_Visible affect/effect that percolates out.



Wordz are the only antidote to all types of `~aSocioaToxica~`

And in its place of actual_discouraging_actz a recipe_of_encouragement can exist. But the two are in fact mutually exclusive meaning, it is difficult to have an enjoyable birthday party with just one person throwing grenades.

So it has to be, that voices_of_encouragement are allowed and enabled to respond correctly to voices_of_discouragement.
The trick required, before that can be actual_reality, is that we need a better way to measure what is actual_encouragement or actual_discouragement. For that, use The_Matrix_of_En_and_Dis.
