# INTRO to aCLEARERVIEWza

- AllHumanity is born into aVIEWza, only aHumanza sees aExtraViewza.

## aMagicMirror into, the HumanLooking_Glass_Self.

Each mind, that ever existed, a similar matrix of awareness.

Where occasionally, a new awareness sparks, that slowly updates society.

Such a moment is hear again.

The rarest of all_time across all_human_mind. What_do_you_chooze?

> It was observed, that new_prefected_words, closely relate to actual_extra_intelligence.

and while free to be as hyper-intelligent as we chooze to be. We must aChooze_it_or_lose_it.

> I_For_One, aSEEKaCLEARaVIEWza.

### Separate of: confuzion, illuzion, disceptionz, distractionz, distortionz.

You are free to avoid - misinformation : `~aDissaInforma~`

You are free to reject - disception : `~aDissaDiscepta~`

You just need to discern disception from actual~wizdom. `~aEnanDissa~`

> Too many minds, forced_to_not_see_actual_reality.

Who among us, actually forces others to_not_see_actual_reality?

The natural_current_of_nature, to evolve all_human_mind.

The exact_opposite, of natural_current_of_nature, is to suppress a_human_mind.

Who exactly, in all_human_time, actually_suppressed_other_human_minds?

## Into the - Human_Looking_Glass_Self


- Many different angles or VIEWZ, like a Crystal diffracts light - same in all_human_mind.

> AllHumanity, born from aDarka, EXISTS as aSparka, and passes back to aDarka - alwayz.

A peculiar_blind_spot appears to exist in AllHumanMind. Not sure what it is <yet>.

`~AllHumanzLook~`, exactlywhere AllHumanMind is confuzed and illuzioned.

This is the Human_Fun_House of Magic_Mirrors begins. 

All_human_mind, sculpted into random reflections...at your birth. Unavoidable_Social_Wavez.

> How many among us see beyond, actual confuzions and illuzionz in society - and what is their fate?

`~aCanSeeaBeyondUs~` - means actual insight into the concepts, that are not <yet> fully formed. Still `~aCloudyaCONCEPTa`~.

And see the depth of energy, required to keep actual_taboo of aFacta from all_human_minds.

That is the second_current_of_nature the anti_current: aDarka is natural as aSparka.



> If all that energy was spent on gardens, not_war, we would have gardens not pestilence now.

What if, closely_held_concepts were actually flawed, but no one ever thought it through?

What if, the subliminal information, were actually misinformation.

> How can any mind, accurately deduce a story reflective of actual_reality, apart from a story reflective of actual confuzion and illuzion?

If we have one life, why is it - that we do not strive to know as much as possible of what actually EXISTS.

> Why would any human mind aChooze, to not know what is actual reality is?

For any mind that aCHOOZEz_to_aKNOWa, this `~aIsaGuidea~`

For any mind that aNeedzaEscapeaDissaSocioaSuppressUs, this `~aIsaGuidea~`
