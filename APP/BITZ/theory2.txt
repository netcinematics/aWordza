# Theory of aHumanaEnigma

There exists before allHumanMinds the enigma of the behavior of all humans around us. Not only are the behaviors of others deeply confusing, but often our own aCarnal behaviors are perplexing. But part of this theory holds that with aDeciphereality, given the aPerfectedWordz - it is ALWAYS possible to separate aClaria from even the darkest aCloudovConfusion. So the aHumanaEnigma can infact be solved, even when we think it can't, and even when we think there is no more answers to be known. *Clarity awaits us.

## aClariaWaitsUs

 For allHumanMinds, clarity awaits for us to find it - whether we know it or not. This is because actual reality exists, waiting for us to be able to see it, evaluate it, and articulate it correctly. *At long last, CLARITY is a PROCESS. aClaria is never something, that any mind, arrives at - without effort. *aClaria (actual act of clarity) is not "balanced" by alternate views, unless we should agree to balance wizdom with actual foolishness.

## aSimilarConclusion

 All sufficiently capable minds, of observing actual reality - will arrive at similar concepts. Given that the concept is actually real. Any two minds, can never view the exact same view, of another mind. Always, on both sides, actual flaws of perception will stubbornly persist, while actual ACTZ of EPIPHANY will randomly aSparka.

## 
 allHumanMinds are born into existence outside of personal control. Whether you are born into confusion or clarity is a pre-defined state. If we are born into aRelativeaClaria, then most of what we are told is honest, with good faith and effort to help us see actueality. The aExactaOpposa is being born in aRelativeaConfusa, which is the experience of being fed total lies constantly, with all the conflict and consequences of aDissaTrusta, that comes from concepts not reflecting actual reality. Both concepts named respectively: aDissaeality and aSocioaDistoxia.

 ## aCommonFlawovAccredita

  How does any institution ever know that what is accredited is actual reality? What if the entire institution is confused? What systems do we have in place for addressing accredidations that are actual provable mimicry, of words, which do not actually reflect actual reality? Or that are purely memorization, disjunct of conceptual epiphany? Seems like an oversight.
  Current humanity places a blind trust on degrees. We call it "accredited". But there exists aCommonFlaw in this thinking - for AnyoneCanSee. 
  * We tend to trust a star athelete's promotion of a sport-drink, because of sometype of 'Conflation', or 'Confabulation' between the 'sport' that they know, and the 'sport-drink' that they actually have zero insight on. Humans are making these types of logical flaws so consistently - it is as if clarity drowns in the cognitive~soup.
  The exact opposite flaw is also clear for AnyoneCanSee, that someone of ability is denied credibility, because recognition - was rejected. This appears to be a horrific flaw in logic that cannot be resolved - because we do not see a better way? *Always, there exists aBetterWay.
  * We tend to trust the mind of a person who has successfully memorized a book. However, this accreditation holds little value, for the myriad of places - where the book does not reflect actual reality. And also where the memorizer - never actually understands the concepts underneath. But is simply using the act of mimicry to repeat the script verbatim - without actual depth of insight into actual reality.

  Through the aINVERSIONz, the aExactOpposa behavior is not to memorize a book verbatim - at all!

  *AllHumanzLook - we should not trust the mind who merely memorizes the words that describe the concepts, but we should trust the mind that deeply understands the concepts - and can demonstrate that.

  *AllHumanzLook, trust the mind informed by EPIPHANY, not the mind formed upon MIMICRY.

  ## TheCognitiveSoup

        The human mind cant possibly sense existence in max-Totality, or in max-Clarity, at any given moment, ever.
        The reason for this is that our senses are under constant barrage at every given second of life.
        And all that information, streaming into your senses - is always partial, and incomplete.
        So all of the ACTZ of all the people around you, always, either: cloud with confusion, spark clarity, or maintain an actual cognitive void. Like a view in a hall of mirrors - you can see actual reality - but it is heavily distorted. Some views reflect actueality clearly, while others actually twist (twizt) and distort the view. All of the human concepts floating around, aZeptos, physical sparks of mind (whatever they are biologically) can be envisioned as a physical ZEPTO, even though... the actual substance of the spark is always partially obscured from all views - except the aHumanaMinda itself.

        All of the ZEPTOs bouncing around allHumanMinds, and the social transmission, aSocioFlowa, that occurs from person to person - it is all aCognitiveSoup.

  ## TheCognitiveSwamp

        With evaluation and articulation it is hypothetically possible to determine if any given concept is clarity or confusion - under one circumstance. That the aHumanaMinda is actually capable of being honest about the concept that is in mind. But with aPretendaKnowa so rampant aCommonFlaw, it is next to impossible to actually trust anything that is said by anyone - especially if born into aCognitiveSwamp.
        
        Key concepts of aHumanaEnigma:
        - ACTZ are often aDissaeality - belief in not actual reality
        - ACTZ are often aNonAWA - not self-aware of the action or behavior or aMetaAWA.
        - ACTZ are often aScriptaMinda - blindly repeated behavior with aMimicaMinda.
        - ACTZ are often aNonaVisibla - actually non-visible, or difficult to prove, aDissApprova.
        - ACTZ are often aDissArgumenta - endlessly arguable, distractionary, and distortable.
        - ACTZ are often aDissaEchoa - Belived factual by repetition, of false-echo, not actual spark of ephiphany.
        - ACTZ of aDissaeality, affirmed by minds of aNonAWA, are clearly discouraging to encounter - and it appears humanity has no Antidote to aDissa (TheAntidotovaDissa), and no Elixir of aClaria (aElixirovaClaria). 
        - AZEPTOs of aClarity are often aSocioaRejecta - wisdom actually rejected by scripted foolishness.
        - aZEPTOaClaria are often aCannotSee - intuition, sense, logic actually non-comprehensible to other minds.
        - aZEPTOaClariaDissa - is the actual discouragement of actual NEW CONCEPTS of CLARITY.

## TheCognitivePretzel

        TheCognitivePretzel is a bunch of concepts, tied in a knot, we cannot unravel, because there is no end.
        TheCognitivePretzel overwhelms us, as we cannot articulate the knot enough, to articulate how it is confused, until put into aBetterWordz, the actual aCloudovConfusion remains in the aHumanaMinda unable to resolve, aNonaResolva, as an actual block on the mind aBlockaMinda. Some minds may experience the aBlockaMinda as aVoidaMinda state of mind. But the fewest of all minds, aCreateaSparka, aExactlyWhere the gap in logic is observable, evaluated, and articulated. Exactly the few minds, who see a CONCEPT missing from the lexicon, and then deliver it to pass down for generations of humanity. Very importantly, most of the aNEOSparka created by our ansestors were perfectly-infallible, or perfectly-flawed? It is aCommonFlaw of anscestral beliefs, aCommonFlawovAnscestra, that we accept everything our dear departed grand-pa said was 100% reflection of reality. Actually, the exact opposite is more observable as we go back in time. It is aFlagrantCommonFlaw, for every instance a human portends new wizdom from old books. Because it is simply obvious, as each generation builds upon the wizdom of the last, that many successive generations through RealTime - would invariably find something flawed in the concepts of aGrandpasJournal. But we dont.
        
        
        A major shock to aClariaMinda, is not only the aCannotSee, but then after good-will attempts at articulation - the aCannotSee becomes: evasive, disceptive, or aggressive... aDissaMinda. ExactlyWhere, instead of learning the concept of actual discouragement, before of a view of a wrongness is seen - is a sense of a need for a defence of mind. Usually, be sense of "a-false-shame", is sensed 'a-false-attack', which Where the logical course of the wrongness, is to not learn of it at all, but to engage in all out defence, against the offending "attacker". Where the MAJOR SHOCK for the aClariaMinda, is not only the aCannotSee, but then aDefensaMinda, and with exaspiration... there is still a second step that aDissaMinda, observably, take to push/force the situation into an actual aCloudovConfusion - and that is the ACTz of Aggressively Defending aWrronga: aDissaWronga, aToxicaWronga, and aSocioToxica. As aDissaForcea, *WeCannotSee the aCHOIZE of aMinda. aExactlyWhere, the mind choozes to not see the COGNITIVE CONCEPTS, where the aZEPTO actually fails to aEPIPHANY, or aCreateaSparka, 

        
        
        *At writing, it appears humanity is confused about how to separate clarity from confusion.
        And aExactlyWhere, we are confused - with actual dishonesty - there is significant discouraging consequence downstream for society. Where discouraging ACTz, are actually forced upon the existence of others, unfortunate to experience it. However, with ZERO WORDS to reference, and articulate such non-visible ordeal - isn't humanity left voiceless, powerless, actionless, and (sometimes) cynical and hopeless? 
        
        *aExactlyWhere, no aid is available, with no remedy yet known. 
        
        aExactlyWhere, no aid is available, with no remedy yet known, sometimes, exists discouraging acts of one human to another, broadly categorized as aDissa. If that discouragement, should be falsely-accepted as justice, because it could not-be-proven-unjust - that is twice as bad, aDoublaWrronga, where the original ACT was bad, and then the EVALz of the ACT was also aWrronga. 

        ~aWrronga - actually really, really wrong act. Of great negative/discouraging consequence, aMajoraWronga. Also often of great cluster of aMinoraWrong into aWrronga. Less often, appears a singular aWronga. Because these will usually stack-up in occurence in aRealTime. The most treasured of ACTz, is when a singular aWronga occurs, but without the shame of punishment, or aNonaKnowa, but so that the aWronga is actually saved in mind as evidence of wrongness. And either directly, or indirectly over aRealTime, gradually acreets into aSparka, of aEPIPHANY, of what exactly was wrong. Not the fantasy of what was aWrong, not the excuse to forever flush-it-from-mind, but the actual realization of wrongness, is often most deeply felt - by the mind that experienced it first with aVoidaMinda, as aDissa, and then EVALz it as aWrongaMeta, and joyously arrives at aSparkAWA, which is the actual epiphany sparking in mind, which actually separates the behavior from OUT of autoaMinda, aOutovAutoaMinda, into aCognitiveality, or aMetaMinda, or aExtraAWA.

        ~aWrongaToaSparka - actual wrongness that leads to learning, aClaria and aWizdo.

    ## aCreateaSparka - acreetion 

    aPerplexia - actual ACTz of Perplexed concept.

    aDissaPerperplexia - 

    aSocioaPerplexia - 

    aMutuaPerplexia - actual mutual perplexed minds, occurs for BOTH when: aClariaMinda aCannotSee aCloudaMinda, AND as aCloudaMinda aCannotSee aClariaMinda.

    aSocioaConfusa - actually confused ACTz of $ociety. WeCannotSee the whole cloud of confusion, while we are in a cloud of confusion, if large areas of concepts are obscured by distraction, distortion, disception, and fantasy - that is a way to map aCloudovConfusion in the CONCEPTS across AllHumanMinds. However, what is the best way to know if you exist within aCloudovConfusion? The answer is - if there is distraction, distortion, disception, or fantasy - directly in your face, everywhere you turn, there is only aCognitiveOverwhelm. You are likely in aCloudovConfusion. Are you in aCloudaMinda? The way to tell, is to go and connect with the minds around you, find out what they "believe". If the CONCEPTS rendered, reflect actual reality, then you are possibly surrounded by sane and wise minds.

    >aSocioaClaria - clarity appears to extend to every distant horizon. How to know aClaria? The highly-abstract underlying notion is aHumanaEnigma:aPerplexaMinda. AllHumanzLook, at the actual divergence, of the InfiniteFabricovZEPTOs, of the aInfinaConzepta. The infinite concepts. Now compare that actual density~of~conceptual~detail - to AllHumanMind, and what AnyoneCanSee, is aGreatDivergenceofClarity. ExactaCausea, Humanity is clearly a young species cognitively speaking. AllHumanzLook, historically at our scant brief moment of awakening. At MAXIMUM, humanity dawns upon self-awareness - as a blip of a microsecond of AllCosmicTime. Humans have been awake for two seconds, and presume to know all that exists, based simpy upon the prior second - where we believe the perception to be truth - except it clearly isn't. AnyoneCanSee, the current state of actual Cognitive~Struggle of the human species. *Humans exhibit a juvenile state of intelligence. So what to do about this? AllHumanzLook, how our solutions to confusion are largely ineffective. We chooze competitiveness, hostility, violence, defensiveness, aggressiveness - OR silence, and stasis, and aHopefulVoid. BUT AllHumanzLook, there was another choize all along. *Outside all Confusion, always exists aEnInversion! You are simply too young of mind to epiphany enough, to see, the behavior of actually seeking wizdom. There should be no shame in this. And a shame of not knowing is where many players will need to discontinue use of aWordza. To general players, there should be aZeroShamea for what you do not know. aNonaShameya. For one reason, AllHumanMind is born, not knowing, and AllHumanMind is destined to at long-last, return to aVoid again. *Humanity looks at AllWizdom with aYoungaMinda. *AllHumanMind awakens with aSparka from the aVoid into AWA, with aRealTime and aEn, reaching aMAXAWA, and always aMinda returning to aVoid. aLife, and aReaLifea. For the advanced players, there should be noShame and noGlory too. In knowing, and not knowing, shame and glory are an illusion. The concepts of aShameya, and aGlorifica - are from aCarnaIllusia. All of this is the aYoungaMinda. A vast swath of not yet articulated concepts, constitutes AllHumanConfusion. 

    ## aTheoryovaWordaGame

    ### Principles

    - for all states of mind, and all actions of humans - can all be well-named.
    - while we can never know exact state of mind in any person at any moment - having well-named states that reflect the actual reality of the mind-state - is very helpful. 
    - So aWordaGame seeks to randomly perfect well-named states of mind, and human behavior.
    - This is an audatious goal, since the sheer number of states-of-mind and all-human-behavior - are perhaps near-infinite.
    - So that is why aWordaGame uses a SYSTEMATIC~PROCESS to RANDOMLY 'aBuildaWords'. With predefined CONSTRUCTz, UTILITYz, WORDz, and other BITz, it appears a succesfull approach to do something previously thought absurd: the word is created, and then we look to see if it is "reflective of actual reality".
    - The name of those SYSTEMATIC~PROCESSES, respectively, are: aBetterWordz and aPerfectaWordza.
    - Then simply run the process, for any CONCEPT. Start with the name, then AllHumanzLook, deeply into the details to see if the aBetterWord, is aDissatorted, somehow, and if it is - that is how to perfect words!
    - Continue changing words, until we arrive at a word that IMPROVES COMMUNICATION, articulates the CONCEPT well, is SELF-EVIDENT, can combine with other words, is not the name of the discoverer(!), but the actual ESSENCE of the ACTUAL EPIPHANY.

    *NeverAgain, should anything be named after the discoverer. That is often a shame to science, exactly because it always misses the opportunity, for us to know the CONCEPT by a SELF-IDENTIFYING-NAME. This is actually a realistic aCommonFlaw that AnyoneCanSee: aCommonFlawovaMisNamea

    ~aPerfectaWordza : actual human actz of improving text and words  and linguistics to better communicate, articulate, evaluate, project and reflect actual reality.  

    ~Actueality  - stands for, the combination of words "actual reality"

    ~aProjectaActueality

    ~aReflectaActueality

    ~aProjectaDissActueality

    *Not having perfected words, appears exceptionally defeating to the human mind.

    *If we were to confuse all the english words, with multiple meanings - not only does it appear to "clog" our ability to communicate clearly, but it also appears to "block" our ability to think, while SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFRONTING other SENSES: "overwhelm" our ability to focus, "trigger" an emotional hi-jacking, and leave us confused, baffled, and perplexed - about actual reality.

    The sheer number of Homonyms in the English language, is evidence enough of poor naming conventions, as aCommonFlaw, through the dawn of human awareness. aCommonFlawovaMisNamea.

# aTheoryovaExtraTellecta
     It is possible to know aExtraTellecta, by looking at the actual CONFUSION and inverting it into - an imaginary answer - of what aExtraTellecta might see, then look back at confusion and see if it dissapates or not.
      1. AnyoneCanSee that aHumana is actually confused about a great many CONCEPTS.
      2. Every CONFUSION can be perfectly named, to reduce confusion. And can be articulated, but we dont.
      3. It is not effective to raise awareness, with words that only cause more confusion.
      4. So if the words were precise, perfected, does it aCreateEpiphany? 
      5. Yes. *Only with clear view of actual reality, can humanity ever aSparkaClaria.

   *The carnal human mind appears to lose focus at: a near-random, threshold: aDropaFocoa.


   aCommonFlawovAlwaysWize - no human is ever always wise, yet we make that assumption mistake comonly.

   aCommonFlawovElderWords - if an elder was wrong, sometimes we choose silence, and drama to enshrine confusion, and then aCreateaCloudovConfusion around it - so that only with great pain and effort, will honest wisdom - ever unseat the falsly-enshrined-confusion.
