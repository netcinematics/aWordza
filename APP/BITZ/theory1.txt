# Theory of aDeciphereality


## Overview 

There is an amazing inversion of ACTZ that humans have yet to exhibit.

Current human ACT appears, to apply a word to a thing - without fully knowing the thing.

Then with great effort defends the naming of the thing, despite great evidence we are projecting fantasy on to the thing - we still do not change the word to match actual reality.

Call this ACT aDefaultaNamea - actual act of default naming. Also this could be known as
aDefensiveaNamea - actually defensive about a name, refusing to change it to more closely match actual reality.

Now there is an INVERSION of ACT, as usual. But has not been observed yet. It is the GRADUAL NAMING of THINGS, realizing that at first view - we cannot possibly name something perfectly. But that over time, as more attributes of the CONCEPT are better understood, the naming of the thing can be of "BETTERWORDZ". Until all attributes of the CONCEPT are known - then we can arrive at aPerfectedWordz. 

The letter 'z' postfix in WORDz, specifies 'remarkable' use of WORD. It is still a WORD, but it has aExtra meaning. Specifically that WORDz are applied to the PROCESS of aBetterWordz and aPerfectedWordz, to maximize naming based on the PRINCIPLES of BetterWordz.

## PRINCIPLES of aBETTERWORDz:

~ aBetterWordz - actually better words, remarkable, because they are of minimal flaw.

SHORT, COMPREHENSIVE, MEMORABLE, COMPOSABLE, SCALEABLE, EXTENSIBILE, SELF-EVIDENTIAL, and GOOD FOR HUMANITY. All of the SYNTAX, is chosen in exactly the concept to aid the senses, with the expressed purpose of not distracting the senses or distorting the senses from actual reality. How best to articulate concepts? How best to evaluate concepts? How best to name concepts? There is this process of "perfecting wordz". 

## Theory of aDeciphereality

So aDeciphereality goes like this, if we were able to guess the "perfectedWordz" for any given concept - would it convey the actual clarity of the concept? And on closer study, it seems this is reasonable. For it is aDefensiveaNamea that is the cause of confusion, not well named concepts. It is concepts that are twisted, or skewed, from reflecting actual reality - which are the sole cause of confusion. But the process of aBetterWordz, is an aid of clarity, to separate it from confusion. They are aExactaOpposa.

With aDeciphereality, within aWordaGame, the PROCESS is to:

- hold a concept in mind, for what it actually is, without any name - or scripted book reference.
- then, apply a sequence of potentially relevant words, within the SYNTAX,
- evaluate which fit the PRINCIPLES best
- these WORDz are then aBETTERWORDz, apart from English words, because WORDz contain aExtra meaning.
- but we are not finished, we do not presume any WORDz to be aPerfectedWordz - for a very long time.
- and even aPerfectedWordz can be changed when more information comes to awareness.
- only after WORDz - perfectly reflect actual reality - may humanity rest with the assertion that any given WORDz is aPerfectedWordz.
- even then, allHumanMinds must hold aPerfectedWordz in mind as - always potentially (partially) flawed.

## Details

aDeciphereality is aExactaOpposa of aDefensiveality. The two ACTZ are aINVERSIONz of one another. AnyoneCanSee this by looking at the behaviors, and realizing they are of exact opposite affect/effect. aDefensiveality is the behavior that defines reality by defending what is already defined, at maximum rejecting actual clarity, to preserve a prior word. While aDeciphereality, holds all WORDz to probably have some minimal flaw, that can be improved somehow to meet the PRINCIPLES of aBetterWordz naming convention. The SYSTEM and PROCESS of aBetterWordz then allows for change of words when we realize that they were informed by misconception, and that the CONCEPT is different in actueality than originally viewed. Thus, aBetterWordz does not defend the wordz, but defends the reflection of actual reality to bend toward aClaria, not aDiscieveYa.

aLawzovEnvolveren - using the aLawzof prefix utility phrase creates opportunity to combine everything so predictable that there is 100% certainty as a 'Law of Nature'. aLawzovEnvolveren then are the LAWz that were named by author envolveren. Stands for actual encouragement of evolution of everyone.

aEnvolveren is an important topic, not just how to evolve human species, but also brings to topic the minds who actively want to stop the evolution of everyone. aDissavolveren. If that CONCEPT is actually held in mind, that is the position that should be defending the concept of why forcibly subjugate humanity under cognitive statis? To this usually the answer is to the effect of: because evolution is wrong. Except we are talking about aEnvolveren, which is not the falseEvolution of everyone. We are not talking about that. That is adistraction, aCreateaConfusion. Why not create better lives for people? Why insist on filling minds with rubbish? ActualFantasy.

At time if writing, Humanity appears deeply confused, around a yet to be articulated topic, and that is how to behave. We seem to have concensus that it is not ok to: lie, cheat, or steal. Or do we? A major part of current aCommonFlaw is the ommission of looking at aTriggerPointz. aTriggera - actual act of being triggered. What causes a person to steal? What causes a person to lie, cheat, or kill? Locking someone up and throwing away the key, does nothing that triggered them to the ACTz in the first place. Humanity appears fully oblivious to this, and if so, it is aYetoArticula. We simply have not correctly articulated the concept in words, which makes it impossible to: reference, discuss, evaluate, and think about clearly. Being denied the words required to think clearly, either intentionally by aDissActorz, or unintentionally by false-EnActorz, is a non-visible tragedy for the human mind - aDissaMentoa, and aSocioaDissaToxia. Once all the pieces are understood, the problem is clearly confusion - which supports the point that articulating new words for concepts that cause confusion is essential to the human mind.

Examples.

aFalsaEn - an encouragement which is actually false.

AllHumanMinds experience a similar perplexing cloud of confusion, which can be articulated - we just havent succeeded at it yet. While the concepts are very abstract, it goes something like this.

You as a child, look up to elders, friends, and influencer, PEERz - where if they pass concepts to your mind that are reflective of actueality, are then encouraging, and you have a chance to grow into a healthy life experience. However, if PEERz (actorz), aChooze to pass concepts that adissareflectactueality, or actually discourage your existence, this is a very confusing non-visible reality (that is difficult to reference and articulate) - and denies a person the opportunity of growth, into a healthy life expereince. The observable state of aDissa, appears to often be: aFrozenInFear.
