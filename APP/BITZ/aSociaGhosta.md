## The Actual_Ghost_Among_Us


Traditional ghosts are abberations of vision and mind, for which we are still not entirely sure what they are <yet>.

`~aGHOSTa~` is a great analogy to borrow, for current states of society, under actual CONFUZION and ILLUZION.

Because there is, in aFACTa, something shimmering before our minds eye, that we have <yet> to make out what it is.

And this abberation of VIEWZ, and MIND (`~aMINDa~`), is root cause (`~aCAUZEa~`) for BOTH good illuzion and bad.

Also, the fear struck into our soul, is so deep, that it quickly casts a life_long_taboo, despite the aFACTa that:

> we_never_really_evaluated the actual_nature of the social_ghost.

We simply gave it a name, and then avoid the concepts with our mind... "like the plague".

> Whatever exists in actual_reality, will have the clearest minds - arrive_at_same_viewz.

Exactly_Opposite, is the repeated_words_of_society that do_not_reflect_actual_reality.

The Actual_Limit_of_Human_Mind.

- All the `~Affect/Effect~` ACTZ that RIPPLE and REFLECT through aSOCIOa

aGHOSTa in the mind occurs, exactlywhere we believe concepts that do not reflect actual_reality.
