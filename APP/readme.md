###  DESCRIPTION:

`~aWORDZa~`, based on English, is a *camel-case-letters* language, and *mix-case-language*, allowing anyone to create TOKENZ of *wordbitz*, that *capture-new-concepts*.

In many cases, **significant_extra_meaning** is realized.

As you can see, aMIXCase is used as a *Name-Convention*. Also below, is an example of *add-single-letters-to-add-significant-meaning*.

#### GOALS: 

- **easy-to-learn**, **self-descriptive**, and brief:

- **fewest-letters-possible**, **fewest_words_possible**.

- for METADATA to (to rhyme song lyrics) as a WORD_GAME.

----
<br>
 
#### EXAMPLE-SYNTAX: 
<br>

**'a'** : is called **LITTLE-A** 
- as a *PREFIX* means **'ACTUAL'** 
- as a *POSTFIX* means **'ACTZ'** 
- `~aSUFFIXa~`

**'z'** : is called **LITTLE-Z**
- as any letter, makes it **'EXACT'**
- clarified or specific, or distinct or unique 
- `~aEXACTa~`
<br>
<br>

#### PURPOSE: 
<br>

- *very important*. To,
- **ADD_METADATA_MEANING** (code example below). 
- **ADD_NAME_CONVENTION** (brevity, self-descriptive, below)
<br><br>

#### EXAMPLE-METADATA 
<br>

For most artificial intelligence, natural language tokenizers, META-DATA-CONTEXT, is a *common requirement*, for WORDS and PHRASES. This is what aMAGICaWORDZa does, but in a different (unique) direction. BECAUSE aWordza started off as defining SONG~LYRICS, the Meta-Data "beneath" the words - is unique. 

> Instead of CONTEXT, aWordza uses CONCEPTZ.

> Over time, it became **SIMPLIFIED & IMPROVED**

> Finally, reduced to the following KEY_CONCEPTZ.

<br>

## EXAMPLE-EXPERIMENT:


---

<br>

To **Enhance_English_Language** (EEL/`~aEELa~`), 

Simply ADD these words to your VOCABULARY:

> `~ACTZ~` - means 'clarified' human actions (behavior). Remarkable, distinct, and unique.

- Allow for ARTICULATION, of actually_vast, **ONTOLOGY & TAXONOMY**, of All_Human_Actz (and much more).

Which opens_a_door_to_CLARIFICTION. Unlike_Ever_Before. With ASTONISHING results.

> ADD self-descriptive WORDS to your VOCABULARY, may ADD the CONCEPT to MIND as well.

With the definitions above, we coin 2 camel-case TOKENZ below. 

Where anyone_can_see, from WORDZ, CONCEPTZ spark into mind. 

> From WORDZ, `~CONCEPTZ~`.

---

> 1) `~aWORDZa~` - actual, clarified and remarkable, words of human ACTZ.

- pronounced: [ah-words-ah].

- a PROCESS & PRACTICE.

- a SYSTEM & TOKEN-ENGINE.

It may seem like nothing, but please DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the **ONTOLOGY & TAXONOMY**.

> 2) `~aWORDaGAME~` - actual game (PRACTICE/PROCESS) of creating vast new language.

- pronounced: [ah-word-ah-gam-eee] - like oragami.

- Once the words are accessed, concepts come to mind. 

Thousands of concepts never before articulated this way.

# aWORDaGAME

<br>

Inspired by Artifical Intelligence project as a graduate student at university.

Original project, was to RHYME-SONG-LYRICS with the GOALS:

> more: meaningful, singable, short & clear, song lyrics.

But something else, much more surprising resulted.

Here is how. <br>

---

#### LYRIC-RHYME REQUIREMENTS: 

1) Tokenize - each WORD into an OBJECT called `~WORDZ~`.

2) add METADATA as `~CONCEPT_underneath_WORDZ~`

Where in CODE, results intwo **programming variables**,

of *WORDZ & CONCEPTZ*.
```JS
let WORDZ = {}
let CONCEPTZ = {}
//*ability inheritance. AI:~`tativity`~.
WORDZ.metadata = CONCEPTZ.
```
Above is **standard-practice** for AI:NLP, to inherit **context-metadata**.
But it also SPARKED many insights afterward.

> Storing concept, to compare between rhymes, generated: "CONCEPTS_under_WORDS".

- a *very important* initial discovery.

---
<br>

### `~CONCEPTS_under_WORDS~` 

Just "like opening a creaky door, into the future"!

Have a LOOK, to SEE for YOURSELF! 

It is amazing, facinating and **FUN!** 

> Become a linguist afficianado today!

Look exactly, at the CONCEPT_beneath_the_WORDS, is the idea.

`~CONCEPTS_under_WORDS~`

---
<br>

### SOCIAL-PHRASE TOKENZ

> Concepts under words, make (really interesting) Social-Phrase Tokens.

`~SOCIAL_PHRASES~`: **super_simple~common_language_patterns**, called **TOKENZ**

> 1) generates many breakthroughs in linguistics.

> 2) significant_value_add with CLARIFIED_WORDS. Called **WORDZ**, with the practice of **better_wordz**, for the good_of_humanity.

- `~Good_of_Humanity~`

- `~aGoaHa~` - actual_actz_for_good_of_humanity.

> 3) Significant new CONCEPTZ_under_WORDZ generated by **Ontology & Taxonomy**.

- viewz_of_conceptz: **beyond_human_mind**
<br>

#### SURPRISING RESULTS:

A fascinating **TOKEN-ENGINE**, running all_words_of_humanity, for Social_Phrases. It did not turn out as expected.

#### REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTICS

The tokenz ,
- SPARK_CONCEPT_into_MIND
- Express_EXACT_ACTZ
- contain METADATA to additional TOKENZ
- in a vast *TAXONOMY & ONTOLOGY*
- and `~front_door_to_all_human_mind~`

---

#### OVERVIEW

Collecting META-DATA on common language patterns is exceptionally important for humanity and all humans in the future.

So much, possibly, the most_important_words_compiled_by_humanz_alltime. 

> It takes a great deal of: TIME, FOCUS, STUDY & PRACTICE, before VIEWZ reflect ACTUAL_REALITY.

---

#### BREAKTHROUGH-CONCEPTZ:

Concepts measurable by linguistic counts.

It reveals `~aPRISMaWORDZa~`:

a) depth: we_say_things_we_do_not_understand.

b) depth: we_do_not_evaluate_CONCEPT_under_WORDS.

It was shocking. Also,

c) depth: add_words_add_CONCEPTS, or exact opposite.

Many more major breakthroughs follow directly after, like.

d) temperature or REFLECTION: that CONCEPTZ reflect ACTUAL_REALITY.

# CONCLUSIONZ

<br>
Please follow the FOCUS and PRACTICE, and help others find the MAGIC of aWORDZa too.
