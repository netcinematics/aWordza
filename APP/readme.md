Actual_Word_Prizm - new WORDZ, to spark new articulation of CONCEPTZ into minds

<br>

- inspired by Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- custom Large Language Model (LLM)

- for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 3 Uses of Language Model of SOCIAL~PHRASES.

- SONG_LYRICS with SOCIAL_PHRASES
  - `~aSOCIAL_PHRASEa~`: advanced ways to rhyme song lyrics.
- `~WORD_GAMES~`, `~aWORDaGAMEa~`: 
  - advanced ways to GAMIFY phrases and symbology.
- `~aPRIZMaWORDZa~`: conceptz for actual_good_of_humanity.

## `~aWORDZa~` & `~aWORDaGAME~` & `~aPRIZMaWORDZa~`:
<br>

Libs of **ENHANCED_ENGLISH**, for *Ai, LLM, & NLP* feedback-loop.

> HELP others PRACTICE_NON-MAGIC_of_aWORDZa! 

For the good of your own clarity of actual reality, or choice to not encourage clarity.

> With `~aBetterWordza~`, and `~aWORDaGAMEa~`, & `~aPRIZMaWORDZa~`.

### What is it?

> Simply a *SYSTEM & PROCESS* of WORDZ to create CONCEPTZ, *TAXONOMY & ONTOLOGY*,

> anyone_can_see, new *CONCEPTZ & VIEWZ* - instantly!

> ~ *RHYME cool new SONG LYRICS, as a WORD GAME!*

###  DESCRIPTION:

`~aWORDZa~`, based on English, is a *camel-case-letters* language, and *mix-case-language*, allowing anyone to create TOKENZ of *wordbitz*, that *capture-new-concepts*.

In many cases, **significant_extra_meaning** is realized.

As you can see, aMIXCase is used as a *Name-Convention*. Also below, is an example of *add-single-letters-to-add-significant-meaning*.

#### GOALS: 

- **easy-to-learn**, **self-descriptive**, and brief:

- **fewest-letters-possible**, **fewest_words_possible**.

- for METADATA to (to rhyme song lyrics) as a WORD_GAME.

----
<br>
 
#### EXAMPLE-SYNTAX & ARTICULATIONZ: 
<br>

**'a'** : is called **LITTLE-A** 
- as a *PREFIX* means **'ACTUAL'** articulation.
- as a *POSTFIX* means **'ACTZ'**  articulation.
- `~aSUFFIXa~`

**'z'** : is called **LITTLE-Z**
- as any letter, makes it **'EXACT'**
- clarified or specific, or distinct or unique 
- `~aEXACTa~`
<br>
<br>

#### PURPOSE: 
<br>

- *very important*. To,
- **ADD_METADATA_MEANING** (code example below). 
- **ADD_NAME_CONVENTION** (brevity, self-descriptive, below)

NOTE: an advanced example of the three letters above, is that it uses linguistics ARTICULATIONZ. Enhancing aspects of WORDS, with added expression. Exactlytwhere, concteptz have Yet_to_be_ARTICULATED. Addressed later. Specifically, the 'a' as an articulation - is a_confuzion_avoidance_mechanizm. 



<br><br>

#### EXAMPLE-METADATA 
<br>

For most artificial intelligence, natural language tokenizers, META-DATA-CONTEXT, is a *common requirement*, for WORDS and PHRASES. This is what aNONaMAGICaWORDZa does, but in a different (unique) direction. BECAUSE aWordza started off as defining SONG~LYRICS, the Meta-Data "beneath" the words - is unique. 

> Instead of CONTEXT, aWordza uses CONCEPTZ.

> Over time, it became **SIMPLIFIED & IMPROVED**

> Finally, reduced to the following KEY_CONCEPTZ.

<br>

## EXAMPLE-EXPERIMENT:


---

<br>

To **Enhance_English_Language** (EEL/`~aEELa~`), 

Simply ADD these words to your VOCABULARY:

> `~ACTZ~` - means 'clarified' human actions (behavior). Remarkable, distinct, and unique.

- Allow for ARTICULATION, of actually_vast, **ONTOLOGY & TAXONOMY**, of All_Human_Actz (and much more).

Which opens_a_door_to_CLARIFICTION. Unlike_Ever_Before. With ASTONISHING results.

> ADD self-descriptive WORDS to your VOCABULARY, may ADD the CONCEPT to MIND as well.

With the definitions above, we coin 2 camel-case TOKENZ below. 

Where anyone_can_see, from WORDZ, CONCEPTZ spark into mind. 

> From WORDZ, we paint `~CONCEPTZ~` in all_minds.

we_paint_conceptz_in_all_human_mind - discovered by SONG_LYRIC, SOCIAL_PHRASES.

---

> 1) `~aWORDZa~` - actual, clarified and remarkable, ACT of words. Or the ability to speak.

- pronounced: [ah-words-ah].

> a simplified enhancement of language.

> of PROCESS_&_PRACTICE, to turn WORDS into WORDZ & CONCEPTS into CONCEPTZ.

- WORDZ_&_CONCEPTZ

- TOKEN_&_TOKENIZER

- SYSTEM_&_ENGINE

It may seem like nothing, but please DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE **ONTOLOGY & TAXONOMY** produced. A vast treasure-trove of language awaits you! Highly transformational - for those who seek it. with express purpose of providing actual_good_for_humanity, not for any mind who may actually_choose_to_avoid_clarity, or of actual_limited_clarity in any way.

NOTE: many advanced topics on the concept of aCLARIa. And exactly how to measure if something is good for humanity or not. Spoiler alert it is Encouragement. ExactOpposite of positive hero, antagonist/protagonist but actual_ACTZ_of_Encouragement. Humanity will do well to seek clarity, with freedom from: toxic_clouds of smoke, fog, ashes, and mud. 

> 2) `~aWORDaGAME~` - actual game (PRACTICE/PROCESS) of creating vast new language.

- pronounced: [ah-word-ah-gam-eee] - like oragami.

- Once the words are accessed, concepts come to mind. 

Thousands of concepts never before articulated this way.

# aWORDaGAME

<br>

Inspired by Artifical Intelligence project as a graduate student at university.

Original project, was to RHYME-SONG-LYRICS with the GOALS:

> more: meaningful, singable, short & clear, song lyrics.

But something else, much more surprising resulted.

Here is how. <br>

---

#### LYRIC-RHYME REQUIREMENTS: 

1) Tokenize - each WORD into an OBJECT called `~WORDZ~`.

2) add METADATA as `~CONCEPT_underneath_WORDZ~`

Where in CODE, results intwo **programming variables**,

of *WORDZ & CONCEPTZ*.
```JS
let WORDZ = {}
let CONCEPTZ = {}
//*ability inheritance. AI:~`tativity`~.
WORDZ.metadata = CONCEPTZ.
```
Above is **standard-practice** for AI:NLP, to inherit **context-metadata**.
But it also SPARKED many insights afterward.

> Storing concept, to compare between rhymes, generated: "CONCEPTS_under_WORDS".

- a *very important* initial discovery.

---
<br>

### `~CONCEPTS_under_WORDS~` 

Just "like opening a creaky door, into the future"!

Have a LOOK, to SEE for YOURSELF! 

It is amazing, facinating and **FUN!** 

> Become a linguist afficianado today!

Look exactly, at the CONCEPT_beneath_the_WORDS, is the idea.

`~CONCEPTS_under_WORDS~`

---
<br>

### SOCIAL-PHRASE TOKENZ

> Concepts under words, make (really interesting) Social-Phrase Tokens.

`~SOCIAL_PHRASES~`: **super_simple~common_language_patterns**, called **TOKENZ**

> 1) generates many breakthroughs in linguistics.

> 2) significant_value_add with CLARIFIED_WORDS. Called **WORDZ**, with the practice of **better_wordz**, for the good_of_humanity.

- `~Good_of_Humanity~`

- `~aGoaHa~` - actual_actz_for_good_of_humanity.

> 3) Significant new CONCEPTZ_under_WORDZ generated by **Ontology & Taxonomy**.

- viewz_of_conceptz: **beyond_human_mind**
<br>

#### SURPRISING RESULTS:

A fascinating **TOKEN-ENGINE**, running all_words_of_humanity, for Social_Phrases. It did not turn out as expected.

#### REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTICS

The tokenz ,
- SPARK_CONCEPT_into_MIND
- Express_EXACT_ACTZ
- contain METADATA to additional TOKENZ
- in a vast *TAXONOMY & ONTOLOGY*
- and `~front_door_to_all_human_mind~`

---

#### OVERVIEW

Collecting META-DATA on common language patterns is exceptionally important for humanity and all humans in the future.

So much, possibly, the most_important_words_compiled_by_humanz_alltime. 

> It takes a great deal of: TIME, FOCUS, STUDY & PRACTICE, before VIEWZ reflect ACTUAL_REALITY.

#### BREAKTHROUGH-CONCEPTZ:

Concepts measurable by linguistic counts.

# CONCLUSIONZ

<br>
Please follow the FOCUS and PRACTICE, and help others find the NON_MAGIC_of_aWORDZa too.
