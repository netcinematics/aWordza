Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

5. All Original PROCESS results Clause

   aWordza shall never intentionally use the words of another author. If any likeness or resemblance, or word arrives, same  as a word used by another author, is purely by coincidence, and simultaneous discovery. Diligent effort is applied to the PROCESS, 
   of these words - to never reference prior works, but to alway create every word, concept, 
   PRACTICE, PRINCIPLE, METADATA, etc - as an ORIGINAL WORK. Direct from a brilliant mind, not an
   interpretation of any prior literal words - ever. This is the PRINCIPLE of Original-Work.
   The inspiration is intended to come from the process, not from prior work.

   aWordza was constructed with the principle of vigorous intent that it not reference any prior work.
   That the total 100% creation was of a personal internal journey by the author, and to great degree the author took extra steps to avoid influence and reference to prior works. The only inspiration provided for aWordza was the observable information of daily existence - available to anyone and everyone - who choozes to see it, and then applied to the PROCESS of NAMING~CONVENTION and SYNTAX that was originally created to RHYME WORDS.

   aWordzaByReferencea - would be a completely separate literary work, that would apply aPerfectaWordza PROCESS to confirmed distant authors coined phrases, by the fully correct reference guidelines, for example "red herring". Probably in the public domain to be renamed to 'actual distraction' not 'red fish' - but author cannot know all these references, and physically does not have ability to undertake vast reference quest ... any word or phrase ever used in prior works - then converted into aWordzaByReferencea. If it is ever done, it would have to be done correctly and in accordance with reference guidelines - but this aWordza is expressely not aWordzaByReferencea.

AND 

6. EXCLUSIVE PUBLIC GOOD USE Clause


   aWurdza is free to humanity to use and reuse for educational purposes forever, and even to make money with aWurdza open-source, with EXCEPTION that
    USE of aWurdza is specific to only good for humanity purposes.
    USE of aWurdza is only for ENCOURAGEMENT of other HUMANS.
    USE of aWurdza is intended only for educational use only.
   
    Meaning must not be used for actual distraction, distortion, disception, 
    or any actual discouraging use for humanity.

    If use of aWordza is twisted in meaning, license holder reserves right to cancel individual copyright license of use of aWurdza. Where License holder reserves right to simply ask those who twist meaning, to stop twisting the meaning, or please stop using aWurdza.

    aWordza had INTENDED USE to positively benefit humans. aWordza is to only be used for the EXPRESSED PURPOSE of GOOD for HUMANITY. If aWordza is negative to a person, that person needs to please stop using aWordza.

7. FICTION/NON-FICTION Clause

   It cannot be known where aWordza is a work of fiction or non-fiction. So aWordza is produced as a work of literary art. aWordza is an artwork, because aWordza contains aWordaGame. It is a PROCESS and a collection of rules, called principles and LAWZ  - exactly as a set of rules for a game to function. aWordza is determined to be entirely fictional, where the encouraged reader decides - what is actual reality. aWordza makes no claim to know what actual reality is... about anything. aWordza is a sofware game, built from a SYNTAX, which helps humans determine what actual reality is for themselves. aWordza is a PROCESS which gradually changes naming as concepts are better understood over time. So it is expected that most names will not be "perfected words", and that all concepts start in a state of natural fantasy/illusion/guess, until modified carefully, to match actual reality, apart from inner-fantasy. At minimum, aWordza is fully-fictional, while at maximum, aWordza is possibly, partly non-fictional. The author of aWordza, made it all up, no one knows if it is fiction or non-fiction, so NetCinematics ascribes this word FICTION. With the view, that no human can ever exactly articulate, which concepts are fully-non-fictional at first, aWordza changes over time, where some parts may, become non-fiction, randomly reflecting actual reality, but  no one will ever actually know which is which. So aWordzaGamea is the CONCEPT of people voting - what is fiction and what is NON-FICTION, and whether the word is perfected or not is up to an ongoing vote of human sense, view, cognition, comprehension, evaluation, and articulation to be actual. Not a guess. Not a feeling. Not a belief of what is actual. But a reflection, after careful study and review, that this concept we hold dear to be self-evident, that they may in due course, someday - reflect what is actual real, apart from a reflection - only in mind. Where the PRACTICE gradually improves, for humans to view "better words", over time, that more closely reflect reality, upon the awareness of new details - until these words are perfected.

8. Statement of PURPOSE Clause
 aWordza is a collection of syntax, linguistics, techniques, principles, practices, innovations, software, words, phrases, utilities, and many other original word patterns as a linguistic SOFTWARE GAME. aWordza is a literary artwork of fiction by NetCinematics llc. The purpose is to only help and benefit "the player" (the reader, or software user), and if the player ever uses software inconsistent with intended use, or if the player is not helped by the TEXT - the player should immediately discontinue use of aWordza.


9. aWordzaGamea is a software game of literary fiction and visual arts, produced by NetCinematics copyright 2017-2022-current. It is released under combined license of CC0 and MIT - with intent to deliver public good to humanity wherever possible. Reader should discontinue use of aWordza, if reader does not view aWordza as a public good. NetCinematics makes no claim to know any clarity or any actual reality, of any kind. aWordzaGamea is a software system, process, and human interaction of voting - what reflects actual reality, or what does not reflect actual reality.

10. No Guarantee of Results

     aWordza cannot guarantee any results for interaction with the game, as a player. Results will vary.
     There is no claim that any WORDz are actual reality it is for the player to decide, and vote on.

     Every text is theory. Nothing is proven. All content is made up by author. Inspired by a Computer Science Syntax. 
     
     
11. Description of Computer Science Syntax.

     Author simply follows a DESIGN PATTERN, to arrive at "LEXICAL~SYNTAX", which informs "LEXICAL~CONSTRUCTS", which in turn result in a systematic iteration of "LEXICAL~FORMULATIONS". Every single one is documented, all are CC0, with an EXCLUSIVE Public Good USE Clause. from the very beginning of the process, which was first a C++ DLL app, saved on a floppy-disk. That software specifically, was the C++ TOKENIZER Engine - that informed The LEXICAL~SYNTAX. Starting with A*titivity. A profound cognitive breakthrough, so vastly underrated, that author perceived these NEAR~RANDOM~MOVEMENT~of~LETTERS~that~BECOME~CONCEPTS... as a trivial game. It was, and forever will be a trivial game - it is the affect/effect on author that was non trivial. Similar results cannot be guaranteed, or even predicted on any other mind. If playing aWordza, causes discouragement, that player must stop playing aWordza. Maybe it is ONLY fiction for Author, by way of Hyperphantasia. Results will vary, dramatically. The original implementation was to rhyme words, via "Social Phrases", to "paint pictures in minds". The idea was to paint a SUNSET, with beach music. But as it turned out, the lexical-brush showed potential beyond beach-music. So that is why Author dedicated full-life to playing aWordza, exactly for benefit of aHumana. As the SYNTAX churns through, near-random permutations of NOUN * titivity, what turns up is - always - a surprise. Should any of these words be "coined"? Absolutely not. If declared lawfully here - every word generated by aWordza is explicitely intended to be free forever for all: default license to CC0 - for every word generated by aWordza. Can people make money off of shirts or posters? Absolutely yes! With one EXCEPTION to the CC0 License. A non-binding personal plea from Author - please, any mind that plays aWordza, and experiences discouragement, the CC0 copyright license is void - and the player must discontinue use. Because the SYNTAX, appears to continue forever. Defined as aSocioaClaria - clarity appears to extend to every distant horizon. If player, choozes to NOT KNOW aClaria - discontinue use immediately. The highly-abstract underlying notion is described under aHumanaEnigma:aPerplexaMinda.
