### Dear Humanity,

An amazing, new_language awaits_you! Ironically, WordGames, turn out to be more transformational than originally thought. And SongLyrics to be more relevant, to all humanity, than possibly expected. EXACTLY_BEYOND_IMAGINATION. We can all see new viewz, at any time: if we chooze to: pragmatically, systematically, and gradually look for new viewz. And once found - name them well. 

This series, "Letters to Humanity..." contains FUN-THOUGHT-EXPERIMENTS, new practices, and tools, for the good of all humanity - current and future! But it is not for all people - who don't want to know Actual_Reality. That is fine. 

> Actual_Reality, Need_Not_Be as chaotic, as our current state of existence. 

This is a SYSTEM devised to decipher the PUZZLE_OF_ACTUAL_REALITY. Using (only) words! It is quite a REMARKABLE DISCOVERY. Containing SIGNIFICANT INNOVATIONS of scientific method. Again, using only words - with DESIGN~PRINCIPLES: with "most consie words", "fewest possible letters", and "metameanings". A PASSION, PURSUIT, and PRACTICE - blossomed into something unexpected. 

> Exactly, The_Other_Side_Of_Confuzion, is articulated, by new_viewz and new_wordz.

A paper for all humans: RESEARCHERS, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, anyone who wants to LEARN to articulate and decipher the PUZZLE_Of_ActualReality. 

Many PRACTICES, a SYNTAX, NAMING-CONVENTION, ONTOLOGY and TAXONOMY, and even SYMBOLOGY, is described in great detail here. 

> aWordza is a more concise language - for All_Humanity. 

Like Enhanced_English, it specifies EXACTNESS through flexibility - not rigidity. A Simplicity-Bridge, over the Complexity of Actual_Reality.

> aWordza is a NATURAL_REFLECTION of what EXITS. a SCIENCE, ART, and STUDY: of new VIEWZ.

## EXAMPLE of PRACTICES

### aNEO~VIEWZa

> New_Views can be easy_to_see, by seeking: "CONCEPTZ beneath WORDZ".

So important for all humanity to discover: "CONCEPTZ beneath WORDZ" and "WORDZ behind ACTZ". There are multiple (new) foundational concepts - to OPEN THE FRONTDOOR to All_Human_Mind. And then PRACTICES, PROCESSES, SYSTEMS, and GAMES - to generate, and innovate extra ACTUAL~HUMAN~INTELLIGENCE.

> aWordza, is a PRACTICE and FOCUS, a SCIENCE and ART, a GAME and a STUDY of Actual_Reality.


### Brief History

Originally build to RHYME SONG-LYRICS with Artificial Intelligence. The innovation, specifically exists, in the LINGUISTIC-METADATA, inspired by Natural Language Processing systems. As far back as the year 2002.

### aNEO~WORDZa

Amazingly, thousands of easy to understand NEW WORDS resulted.  Based on a small SYNTAX and NAMING CONVENTION. Described here. Where, "little_language_tricks" were added, to ENHANCE LANGUAGE EFFECTIVENESS, while aspects that were found to actually limit clarity, are avoided.

The results were profound. It is called aWordza.

## ~aWORDZa~

> ‘aWordza’ - meaning: actual act of clarified words. Here is how…

### A) SYNTAX and NAMING CONVENTION 

- as simple as possible

**
#### ~A_Little_A~
**

’a’ - the “little a” :

- great effect! Use as: PREFIX, POSTFIX, and MIDFIX.

INNOVATION: a single letter 'a', to vastly clarify English!


**
#### B) SYNTAX 1: ~aPREFIXa~
**

’a…*’ - “PREFIX-a” :

DESCRIPTION:

- “little a” at the BEGINNING of any word.
- Pronounced ‘ah…’ : in front of Captial letter word.
- Means: ACTUAL. Actual_Reality. Or...
- ~ActuReality~ 
- Specifically speaking in ACTUAL-TERMS.
- NonHype, NonSpin, NonDisception, NonConfuzion, NonIllusion.
- Specifically speaking of Actual Reality.
- Specifically Non_Misinformation.

EXAMPLE of building a Wordza from the word 'example':

’aExample’ - pronounced [ah-example], means: actual example.

#### SYNTAX 2: ~aPOSTFIXa~

’*…a’ - “POSTFIX-a” :

  - “little a” at the end of any word. 
  - Pronounced “…ah” : means, a human action 
  - Meaning: ACT. Specifically 
  - \~ACTZ\~ : clarified human actions.   
‘aExampla’ - prounounced[ ah - exampl - ah ], means: act to give actual example.

        -  these become VERY IMPORTANT later, when applied to LANGUAGE. 
**
#### SYNTAX 3: ~aMIDFIXa~
**
’*…a…’ - “MIDFIX-a” :

  - a “little a” inbetween any two words. 
  - Pronounced “…ah…” : means, ALL 
  - Meaning: ALL. Specifically, every instance of some act. 
‘aExamplaWordza’ - prounounced[ ah - exampl - ah - Words - ah ].

means: act of providing examples of all of aWordza - the ontology of clarified words..

INNOVATION:

- Ontology and Taxonomy for all human actz, or any concept that exists.

          - These are just example, but actual use is limitless. Here is one more. 

#### SYNTAX 4: ~a_Little_Z~

’*…z…’ - “little z” :

  - a “little z” replaces ‘s’ or ‘soft c’, anywhere in any word. 
  - Pronounced the same as a ‘S’ : means, CLARIFIED, 
  - REMARKABLE. Specifically, differentiates a new word. 
EXAMPLE:

‘Wordz’ - is specifically different from Words*,* its clarified a unique, specific meaning.

1) LANGUAGE GOALS

Enhance English by making words:

- more precise, concise (short).

- EASY TO LEARN, and SELF-DESCRIPTIVE.

- Actually accurate! Not vague, ambiguous or cliche.

- High Density Concepts - packed into few letters and words.

- Avoid useless grammer rules. Add powerful grammer rules.

2) LANGUAGE PURPOSE

The original purpose was to rhyme song lyrics. But that aim has changed many times, after writing the METADATA for SOCIAL~PHRASES. Because, trying to define language, as metadata has a way of forcing open the FRONT-DOOR to all HUMAN-MIND.

It was astonishing to stumble upon. But anyone_can_see - if we chooze_to_look!

The METADATA of SONG LYRICS is actually tranformational. It is the ACTZ of a series of VIEWZ or Thought-Experiments.

A) Trying to express CONCEPTS, that actually exist beyond words.

  - We are actually missing words. 

  - Our current words are FAR from precise. 

  - We can actually do better at passing CONCEPTS from mind-to-mind. 
B) Listening to WORDS of Songs, can AFFECT many CONCEPTS, in mind.

  - Like “painting pictures in minds”, what are the concepts PROJECTED/REFLECTED? 
C) What is the original “CONCEPT BENEATH WORDS”?

aWordza solves all those pesky language blockers - and more. Here is how.

3) Language NAMING - CONVENTION - add super powers! **
**
Software Developers will recognize a syntax “borrowed” from COMPUTER SCIENCE, called “CamelCase”. It is a naming-convention, in aWordza, adding liberty to characters.

For literature: ThisGivesUsTheAbilityToCombineWords.

And is a very powerful construct to use. For the good of humanity. Also…

UPPERCASE is no longer just for 1st character anymore!

All caps, is more functional when it means: QUICK-SCAN-ABILITY for KEY-CONCEPTS in a blog. Not a shout! We have other (better) ways to express that.

More importantly - use Staggered-CAPS - for the ability to combine multiple words - into single NEW~WORDZ. And All-CAPS - to speed read, and make KEY CONCEPTZ in a blog - easier to read!

4) Ontology and Taxonomy - more SuperPowers!

In code, every word has to be precise, and every named variable has to be unique. These same concepts can be applied to naming conventions like GEOLOGY and MEDICINE. aWordza is a dynamic scientific naming convention - for ANY CONCEPT - with linguistics. Applied to any medium, music, wordgame, or philosophy - the result of new words is potentially infinite.

So the scope is massive. Every “CONCEPT beneath WORDS” in All_Human_Mind - in All_Human_Time, now, and in the future. Where the wordz, write themselves - based on what the concept is - not the name of the observer (for example). These WORDZ, far more clarified and extra functional - allow more clear and articulated - CONCEPTZ.

As if opening, the front-door to the human mind - and a blizzard of concepts BOTH actual and non-actual blasts out. aWordza is a SYTEM that results in the BETTER NAMING of THOUSANDS of NEW WORDS. But could end… with many more.

All of those words, will be stored online in a Taxonomy and Ontology. And this is the start of that!

CONCLUSION:

Welcome to aWordza! Admittedly, the SYNTAX is dry, but later - it gets FUN! Like riding a bicycle: at first scary, then exciting, and eventually boring. The act of WORDCRAFTING… can be deeply ENLIGHTENING. The results are continually more profound than comprehensible. To see, please try, and share it with friends!
