# FRONT-DOOR to ALL_HUMAN_MIND

This paper, continues Letters to Humanity... series. As it CREATES NEW WORDS as a (draft) ONTOLOGY and TAXONOMY for AllHumanMind.

It is a UNIQUE VIEW, of new Ontology. Educated and aware of contemporary views, but also a fresh innovation, and view. With a KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLE, to not rely on previous vocabulary - but to create an Enhanced_English, of more effective (easy to remember and understand) description. Using NEW SYNTAX and LANGUAGE CONVENTION - to solve the PUZZLE_OF_ACTUAL_REALITY. Avoiding lenses and biases, that BLURRY the VIEW. Specifically, a Language that CLARIFIES, ARTICULATES, and invites CURIOSITY!

This vast constellation of new wordz - is important to all humanity - please tell a friend who may be interested. This paper is for RESEARCHERS, STUDENTS, TEACHERS, and anyone who wants to LEARN.

Let us enter, the FRONT-DOOR to All_Human_Mind!

## Bias runs deeper and wider than we think. 

> Bias is only one leaf, on a family-tree of confuzion.

In a previous letter, a few IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS were shared:

- FOCUS: on "CONCEPTS_beneath_WORDS" 

- Then PRACTICE: aBetterWordza.

'aBetterWordza', in short-form 'aBettaWordza', 

- means : actual act of crafting better words.

- It is only STEP 1, of MANY STEPS - to Decipher_Actual_Reality

### Major Breakthrough in Linguistics

It was noticed that the SYSTEM, or WORD-ENGINE, could work in 2 ways.

#### 1) `~aWORDZa~` - We look at EXISTENCE, and NAME CONCEPTS with aBettaWordza.

   - Link those unique words into new ONTOLOGICAL_VIEWZ. Sparks new Clarity.

   - Of significant benefit. But the SYSTEM can run in REVERSE also.

#### 2) '~aREVERSEaWORDZa~`

   - By churning through WORD-COMBINATIONS, systematically, CONCEPTZ aSparka.

   - CONCEPTZ manufactured by aWORDaGAMEa.

#### 3) '~aReflect_a_REALITY~'

   - All facts ('aFactz') and falseness ('aFalza') - can be known by holding any CONCEPT up the LIGHT_of_ACTUAL_REALITY - and looking for a REFLECTION or DISTORTION.

   > Where CONCEPTZ are CLEAR_CONZEPTZ, aNONaFOGGY_CONZEPTZ, but ARTICULATED and CONCISE - we see a REFLECTION of ACTUAL_REALITY.

   > Where CONCEPTZ arise from folly of confuzion or illuzion, are FOGGY_CONZEPTZ, or FUZZY_CONZEPTZ. Shrouded in mystique, we see a DISREFLECTION of ACTUAL_REALITY.
   
   > Cognititve_Mystique is only necessary to protect the edges of illuzion. 
   
   Observance, of conceptual_mystique alone, is enough to infer the STATE_OF_CONCEPT in mind. Beneath the words, an INABILITY to SPECIFY, or INABILITY to CLARIFY, or INABILITY to PRACTICE aBettaWordza - for the CONCEPT therein - identifies the state of CONCEPTS as not yet fully focused. Not yet fully articulated. All Humanity, desperately need this CONCEPT.
   
   > That our Language should reflect the STATE of reflection or disreflection of our CONCEPTS.
   
   And by Nature, represent an actual distortion of VIEWZ - in minds, generations, and societies. 
   
   So common, a fundamental construct of All_Human_Mind:

   > We must FIRST_QUESTION actual_reality, and PRETEND_TO_KNOW_IT, before we can see our blindspots of folly, and reflect on actual_reality, MORE_CLEARLY, by contrast, and then exists a long-tail, of NeverFullyKnow, of what exists directly behind our VIEWZ. Like the blindspot of staring at a blackhole, the distortions around the edges - give tremendous details - of what exists in the distance.

## METHODOLOGY

Look more carefully at words, and evaluate concepts underneath.

In AI, this is a TASK to add CONTEXT to TOKENZ as METADATA.

And was the inspiration to apply the CONTEXT_METADATA,

from the programmatic realm to the linguistic realm.

With great irony, the attempt to solve computer_context, something spectacular about humanity.

> The reality that all_human_concepts, are more blurry_&_fuzzy as a result of our language, existant as a "patchwork" innovation.

> better_wordz is actual_clear_reality, because it forms better_conceptz_beneath_wordz


## TAXONOMY & ONTOLOGY

A heirarchical structure developed across thousands of new words.

The TAXONOMY is oriented by MATRIX_of_aEn_and_Dis, after realizing that 

> Viewz of "positivity" and "negativity" are a binary view, that
> does not reflect_actual_reality as well as `~aEn~` and `~aDis~`.

The ONTOLOGY is a minimal SYNTAX and NAME-convention:

- to enhance_english with fewest words and letters

- with self_descriptive_word_ability to be easy to learn

- with easy word_combine_ability, 

- as a repeatable SYSTEM and PROCESS ( token_engine ) 

> to better_name every past, current and future, concept_beneath_words
