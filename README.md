## Artificial Intelligence project to Rhyme Words in C++.

It started as a "LEXICAL TOKENIZER", using "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING", an obscure branch of AI, suggested to me by a professor, for a graduate project. It was fascinating!

Like most AI projects, the challenge seems simple at first, even trivial, and then it turns into something entirely different! That is what happened here. The results were unexpected. What happened, happened by accident. It was never intended to morph as it did. The morphing of purpose was unexpected and unanticiapated. Exactly where, the system, it seems - to follow the edge of human cognitive limit.

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION

The innovation of aWordza, is based on PRINCIPLES, in a SYSTEM of PROCESSES. It has an ORIGIN_STORY, and PRACTICEz, CONSTRUCTz, UTILITYz, and literally THOUSANDS of WORDz.

Checkout the INTRODUCTION.

./INTRODUCTION.txt
The word aWordza itself is ENCODED like this:

~ 'aWordza' - actual act of remarkable words.

The PROCESS is called aWordaGame, pronounced [ah - word - ah - gah - mi], like Oragami.

Nobody owns this process, because it is a way for any human to make sense of their actual surroundings. Nobody could ever own this process, because it is specifically designed of the nature that - a person held in confinement of total isolation, could use this process, to make sense of existence. 


## Essence of Process

At a very low level. The process of aWordza is aWordGame, which formulates WordToolz to aid in understanding of actual reality. It does so by rearranging letter... in any way that improves communication, based on the PRINCIPLES.

## PRINCIPLES

SHORT, COMPREHENSIVE, MEMORABLE, COMPOSABLE, SCALEABLE, EXTENSIBILE, SELF-EVIDENTIAL, and GOOD FOR HUMANITY. All of the SYNTAX, is chosen in exactly the concept to aid the senses. How best to articulate concepts? How best to evaluate concepts? How best to name concepts? There is this process of "perfecting wordz". 


An analog training for a blind person to understand sight, or a deaf person to understand sound. aWordza is designed for a neural typical mind to understand, the actual behaviors, actions, insights, concepts of extra experience of perception, cognition, sensitivity, emotion, and of all things... aExtra.  It is like that.

And it was all because of one Professor, and a professional Architect who acted as a mentor.

THANK YOU!!!

## ORIGIN_STORY

The concept was to use C++ to RHYME WORDS. That's it. So I asked my professor for a list of all words in the English Language.

Honestly, I thought he would balk at the idea. But in his characteristic way, he turned his head to the side, thought about it and said, "I'll get back to you on that".

Indeed he did! He returned with a brute force list of words that maxed out the 1.4mb floppy disk (this was just after the 90's).

And the Word-Rhyming Project was born!

## The Project Expands.

I didn't pursue a graduate degree in CS because - I found a great job that made great money!

But I kept up the C++ project... to this day (20 years later). In my day job, I was building C++ databases with DLL Modules.

So it was a PERFECT FIT for The Rhyming Engine. I shared the idea with my Architect at the time over lunch. To my surprise he was enthused with the concept.

He then introduced me to a more obscure branch of Artificial Intelligence... that very few people explore. Natural Language Processing.

I accepted his guidance, and began building a "Tokenizer Engine" in ernest.

## Short Details

The file I had been given from the professor, was now being iterated over by the C++ DLLS that were chopping the words into "Tokens". Then analyizing the words into META-DATA.

Original Meta-Data was "POSTFIX". And the intention was to start a company with the following mission statement:

> Generate Song-Lyrics that are More SINGABLE, MEMORABLE, CATCHY, and VISUALLY INSPIRING.

Which is how, gradually... with naivete... I began expanding to POSTFIX, and many more elegant CONSTRUCTS.

## A PC App

The company didn't go anywhere. Because I realised that the target market was... non existant.

Also this was before GitHub, and also before JavaScript Open-Source. So it went into hibernation for many years.

I still wish I would have written it in JavaScript because it would be a very powerful online engine. That is what it is transforming into now, in Web3.

It is actually a C++ PC app on a floppy disk somewhere! The reason why I bring it to GitHub, after all these years, is that it didn't remain an engine for creating song-lyrics after the company closed down. The engine kept on working. The PROCESS (aWordaGame), it runs in my mind, even while I sleep - at a speed measured in "thoughts per second". For all humanity, a recommended speed of evaluation is 'thoughts per minute'.

You see, because the mission statement was to make link words that are Memorable and Visual in the mind... the project crossed an invisible boundary into new territory. 

Which meant, that the engine was operating at a much higher level than for just singable songs - and I didn't recognize it for a very long time.

## Conclusion

For decades, I created new inputs and observed the outputs - they surprised me so frequently, I turned to journaling, the puzzle, across hundreds of notebooks. Then recorded the "PRINCIPLES" and the "CONSTRUCTS".

Only then did I realize what was happening. It was it was creating a new language. Something better than English. It was all very organically assembling. I honestly did not feel like a creator, or innovator, inventor, of words - but more an explorer of the human mind.

As a hobbie, I let it continue for another decade, up until the point that I needed to realease it on GitHub.

And that is what this is. A placeholder for something quite spectacular. I have always wanted to go back to school, for the PHD, to continue this research project - but it makes no sense at all. Because there is nothing like this at any university that I know of - and I am already doing the work effectively.

This repository contains very interesting and actual breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence, using Natural Language Processing. As in the description, software for RHYMING SONG LYRICS, with some very surprising METADATA!

All thanks to a Professor willing to entertain the spark, and a C++ Architect willing to go the extra mile, and act as a mentor.
