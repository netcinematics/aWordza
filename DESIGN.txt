DESIGN

The purpose of this repository and also of these concepts,

is to build a CONCEPT~WIKI, from the work of deep-thinking, 

and intellectual PRACTICES for over 20yrs.

All the BITZ, can be precisely organized into LINKED UI,

for gradual consumption, and sharing.

They can also be MINTED on the BLOCKCHAIN. 

And POSTED through various formats like TWITTER.

A twitter bot is planned. As is a UI for MINTING.

## Architecture

root level has APP folder.

In that folder is BITZ folder.

An html index will load and serve the bitz.

No need for a node server, if there is a numeric naming convention.

If next is null, we are at end. If last is null, we are at the beginning. 

Logic to Loop. Horizontally. Through BITZ.

Metadata to link BITZ together.

BITZ can have vertical sections. Up and down scrolling.

Possibly a display for markdown.

Possibly links from markdown.

Metadata, hardcoded, can provide best meta links.

METALINKS could be section, populated by METADATA.

Found two great links for how to statically load .txt.

Combined with naming convention starting at 1000++
4 digits makes the id obvious it is an id.

Also a folder called MSGz for...
automated social media messages like tweets.

## Construction phase:

Fork COZMOSPAZE (?)

Create new view. Into copy index.

Reduce to NEW TEMPLATE: METALINKz_APP

Multiple MetaLINKz
