DESIGN

The purpose of this repository and also of these concepts,

is to build a CONCEPT~WIKI, from the work of deep-thinking, 

and intellectual PRACTICES for over 20yrs.

All the BITZ, can be precisely organized into LINKED UI,

for gradual consumption, and sharing.

They can also be MINTED on the BLOCKCHAIN. 

And POSTED through various formats like TWITTER.

A twitter bot is planned. As is a UI for MINTING.

## Architecture

root level has APP folder.

In that folder is BITZ folder.

An html index will load and serve the bitz.

No need for a node server, if there is a numeric naming convention.

If next is null, we are at end. If last is null, we are at the beginning. 

Logic to Loop. Horizontally. Through BITZ.

Metadata to link BITZ together.

BITZ can have vertical sections. Up and down scrolling.

Possibly a display for markdown.

Possibly links from markdown.

Metadata, hardcoded, can provide best meta links.

METALINKS could be section, populated by METADATA.

Found two great links for how to statically load .txt.

Combined with naming convention starting at 1000++
4 digits makes the id obvious it is an id.

Also a folder called MSGz for...
automated social media messages like tweets.

## Construction phase:

Fork COZMOSPAZE (?)

Create new view. Into copy index.

Reduce to NEW TEMPLATE: METALINKz_TEMPLATE

Multiple MetaLINKz

- Static Programmable LINKs.
All populated with METADATA, by num ID:
100 - MetaLynx w/ AlpineFalcon
1000 - aWordza
100000 - Orby_in_SPAZEBOTZ

a for in/of object key loop.


- With DYNAMIC LINKS.
load the text to screen word-by-word.

Providing AI NLP to the streams.

Programmable syntax - can be inlcuded here.
# Topic (for example)

But then much more. 

Specificaly, by wordmatching, we can linkback all references, to a singular definition!

the way to LINKBACK. Is a wordsearch while loading words. 

Then, where a match is found (aWordza) it replaces the word

with the link, or set of links like 2_, 3_, 4_.


VOTE. the vote is based on digital wallets, or later soul tokens.]

there will be textual comments for affirm or dissent.

And there will be ability to LINKBACK to NEW TOKENS, for members.
