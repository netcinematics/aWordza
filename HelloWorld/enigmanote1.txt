SYNOPSIS of 'TheHumanEnigma'.

This post attempts to FRAME an ENIGMA, for PEER REVIEW, with FOCUS on LOGIC points ('>'), of how a (potential) BREAKTHROUGH, was accidentally found. For REPLICATION, refined STRATEGY of PUBLICATION.

OVERVIEW:
After careful study, it appears the greatest enigma of humanity - still awaits us. With the vast expanse of space coming into view, a final frontier appears to now be : How to Scientifically Decipher The Human Mind.

That is the FOCUS and PURPOSE here. LOGICAL steps for REPLICATION, by PEER GROUPS: to Decipher - a unique view into the HUMAN MIND, with (overlooked and underrated) ADVANCED LINGUISTICS.

A new window to the Human Mind, Not the Iris, not EKG, but in careful analysis of simple/common WORDS.

> Linguistic Analysis as a backdoor into actual human cognition. Actual scientific practices, long missing.

And what a SHOCK to view! Everything is a surprise. Nothing as expected. So much askew. All founded by accident. All SYSTEMATICALLY formulated by AI MECHANISM of (careful) step-by-step LOGIC PUZZLE (myriad).

We begin there. CONFUSIONS, ILLUSIONS, EPIPHANY, and the CRITICAL ROLE of the GIFTED MINDS in Society. Rendered into view by careful analysis of COMMON WORDS - called SOCIAL~PHRASES.

Immediately, the behavior of MIMICRY reveals itself, followed by a vast trove of other behaviors that slip beneath our senses, and seemingly... our ability to ARTICULATE. So that is the FRAME of 'TheHumanEnigma'.

QUESTION: How can we resolve 'DeepConfusions', without words? Without 'PerfectedReferences', the theory below, attempts to show (step-by-step) the result state of society: "stuck in confusion". The hypothetical state - if we are in it - 'TheHumanEnigma'. And how to get out.

That was the inception of 'aWordza'. A TEST of our surrounding COGNITIVE~SOUP. A technique to cut through blizzard of confusion.

SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS:
< Is there intelligence without words?

< Is intelligence the result of 'BetterWords'?

< Does awareness increase with 'PerfectedWords'?

< Does confusion in words cause confusion for: logic, rationale, and concepts?

< If our concepts, were actually 'filled with confusion', what would it look like, how would we know, and ...

< What is an EFFECTIVE~MECHANISM, to consistently decipher CLARITY from CONFUSION?

With 20yrs of careful study of these questions here are a few key points that led to 'aWordza'.

It appears that:

> 1) a LIMIT on WORDS is also a LIMIT on CONCEPTS in mind.

*If we Limit WORDS, does it limit CONCEPTS, does it limit MINDS?

> 2) Historically, where CONCEPTS are actually LIMITED, do we see increase in Flights-of-Fantasy, or SOCIAL~CONFUSION?

*Can human confusion be measured in words? Specifically hollow~words.

*Can words be measured to show Clarity of Insight, rich in detail, apart from words of distraction, that cause cognitive overwhelm?

*Can we detect MIMICRY of WORDS, with hollow~concept beneath?

*Can we detect EPIPHANY from ILLUSION, or memorized answer from wisdom?

*How do Humans tend to respond to actual flawed concepts and misnomers - do we adapt rapidly?

*How do we tend to act in disagreement - is it effective at promoting awareness and clarity?

*What would be a more effective mechanism for adapting actually flawed concepts and misnomers?

> 3) the inverse might also be (hypothetically) true. Also potentially testable/replicatable.

*Does AN INCREASE in "perfected words" result in INCREASE in SOCIAL~AWARENESS and decrease in CONFUSION/ILLUSION/Fantasy?

> 4) All of that is FRAME of TheHumanEnigma.

If it feels like we are a society trapped in ILLUSION~CONFUSION~FANTASY ACTZ (remarkable behavior) - is it because we are trapped by an actual LIMIT on WORDS?

> 5) Specifically SYNTAX, of English, appears highly-flawed in CONJUGATION. In Computer Science terms - "the WORDS do not SCALE". Meaning, English does not EXTEND well. We were forced to solve this in software - to get it to work!

We used 'Naming Conventions'.

*Do humans "struggle" from hitting actual LIMIT of WORDS?

*Does limited language LIMIT MINDS?

*Inability to ARTICULATE and EVALUATE, stuck at COGNITIVE~IMPASS?

*A NON~VISIBLE~ENIGMA!?!

> 6) Would a LIMIT on WORDS and CONCEPTS leave us in a VOID?

To be filled by charm of FANTASY, flights of ILLUSION, and brazen ACTZ of disception (not easily disproven)?

Would we see TwiztedLogic, Rampant Argumentation, ends in ineffective, tragedy of IMPASS we call "agree to disagree"?

*Could we reveal all this in ADVANCED~LINGUISTICS?

> 7) In SOCIAL~PHRASE: "all is not lost", "there is another way".

*Does CLARITY (still) AWAIT all Human Minds?

* If we add perfected words, historically, (bigbang) the heated debate evaporates into awareness?
MIMICRY? Not void, not IMPASS?

*Is struggle for CLARITY resolved by 'PerfectedWords'?

*What if we GUESS PerfectedWords correctly? Does CLARITY follow?

Like "blackhole"

*Does that word help us understand actual reality?

*Or hinder us?

> 8 ) Word EXAMPLE:

'blackhole' was seen in MATH as zero light (black) and infinite compaction past zero, into negative numbers (hole).

But what if, in actual reality... a 'blackhole' was later seen to be neither totally black (gamma jets), nor a hole at all!

*What of the word 'blackhole'?

*Do humans adapt words easily - to more accurately reflect reality?

*Or do humans exhibit a relative 'stuckness' on words and concepts?

*Was the popularity of 'bigbang' and 'blackhole' - because of how well they describe actual reality?

*Or was it because they were SHORT, EASY TO REMEMBER words, easy to REPEAT, SPARKED our imagination, and engage in a Flight of Fantasy?

Like a meme.

> 9)
*While neurotypical minds appear to repeat scripted concepts, verbatim, and praise each other for it...
is it the gifted mind that (avoids scripted thought) and brings new thought to the forum?

*How is the gifted mind treated when bringing actually brilliant thought to the mind of society?

*Are gifted people actually discriminated against, unconsciously, by a society unable to articulate, and EVALUATE - so on "auto pilot" - overwhelm - compare incomprehensible to social~script

And reject actual brilliance as "crazy"?

> 10)

*Is such behavior systemic for all humans?

*What is effective way out of systemic~social~confusion?

'aWordza'.


TAKEAWAY:
I do not know where to publish this work. I wish to form a talented open-source group for peer review of a TREASURE TROVE of advanced topics, like this. Into something like a COGNITIVE~WIKIPEDIA, forever, on BLOCKCHAIN.

'aWordza' includes PRACTICES, like Yoga promotes 'mindfullness'.
And how psychology (tragically) promotes the misnomer of 'overthinking' to be a cure-all.

But these are...

PRACTICES of FOCUS.

PRACTICES of CLARITY.

PRACTICES to detect CONFUSION.

PRACTICES to promote PLASTICITY.

> 11)
*Does CONFUSION limit PLASTICITY?

*Is it true that PLASTICITY stops in old age, or is it possible, we fill our minds with flawed concepts - that we refuse to change?


Much more...
